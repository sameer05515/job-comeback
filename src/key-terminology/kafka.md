### 🔹 **Advanced Concepts**

| Term                        | Meaning                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Leader Partition**        | Main partition replica for reads/writes                |
| **Follower Partition**      | Replica for fault tolerance                            |
| **Replication Factor**      | Number of copies of partition data                     |
| **Retention**               | How long messages are stored                           |
| **Compaction**              | Cleanup policy to retain latest key-value              |
| **Schema Registry**         | Manages Avro/Protobuf schema evolution                 |
| **Zookeeper**               | Used by older Kafka versions for cluster coordination  |
| **Kafka Connect**           | Framework to move data between Kafka and other systems |
| **Kafka Streams**           | Library for building stream-processing apps            |
| **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** | Stores failed messages for later reprocessing          |

### 🔹 **Configuration & Delivery**

| Term                    | Description                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **acks**                | Controls producer write durability (`0`, `1`, `all`) |
| **idempotent producer** | Ensures no duplicate messages                        |
| **at-most-once**        | Messages may be lost                                 |
| **at-least-once**       | Messages may be re-delivered                         |
| **exactly-once**        | Ensures each message is delivered once and only once |

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform with core concepts like producers, consumers, topics, partitions, offsets, and consumer groups. It supports high availability, fault tolerance, and real-time data processing at scale."

---

Type:

* `kafka-interview-questions` → only question set
* `kafka-config-cheatsheet` → tuning & property summary
* `kafka-vs-rabbitmq` → comparison table

🚩 **Fullstack Developer + Kafka → Interview Mein Kya Aana Chahiye (Minimum Viable Knowledge)**
*🔥 Target: Practical + High-yield questions (Java/Spring Boot + basic architecture)*

---

## ✅ **1. What is Apache Kafka (in 1 line)?**

Apache Kafka is a distributed, high-throughput **event streaming platform** used to build **real-time data pipelines and streaming apps**.

---

## ✅ **2. Key Kafka Terminology (You MUST Know)**

| Term               | Description                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Producer**       | App that sends data to Kafka                             |
| **Consumer**       | App that reads data from Kafka                           |
| **Topic**          | A logical channel for messages (like a folder)           |
| **Partition**      | Kafka splits topics into partitions → allows parallelism |
| **Broker**         | Kafka server that stores and serves data                 |
| **Consumer Group** | Group of consumers sharing a load of messages            |

---

## ✅ **3. What should you know as Fullstack Dev (Java/Spring Boot)**

### 🔹 Kafka Integration Basics:

* Use of `spring-kafka` dependency
* Creating **ProducerConfig** and **ConsumerConfig**
* Writing `@KafkaListener` methods to consume messages
* Serializers/Deserializers (usually String, JSON)

### 🔹 Common Interview Questions:

1. How do you produce/consume Kafka messages in Spring Boot?
2. What is idempotency in Kafka?
3. Difference between Kafka and RabbitMQ?
4. How does Kafka ensure message ordering?
5. What happens when a consumer fails?

---

## ✅ **4. Sample Code Concepts You Should Know**

### 🔸 Kafka Producer (Spring Boot)

```java
@Autowired
private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

public void sendMessage(String message) {
    kafkaTemplate.send("my-topic", message);
}
```

### 🔸 Kafka Consumer

```java
@KafkaListener(topics = "my-topic", groupId = "my-group")
public void listen(String message) {
    System.out.println("Received: " + message);
}
```

---

## ✅ **5. Optional + Good-to-Have Topics**

* Kafka offsets & how consumer tracks them
* Kafka retention policy (logs)
* Difference: At-most-once, At-least-once, Exactly-once delivery
* Kafka in Microservice architecture – for **decoupling** services
* Use of Kafka UI tools like Kafka Manager, Conduktor (optional)

---

### 📁 Bonus Prep Format:

Create this file: `kafka-fullstack-guide.md`
Break it into 3 parts:

* Concept in 1-liner
* Key interview questions
* Code snippets (Producer + Consumer)

---

Say next:

* “Guruji, Spring Kafka ka config code do”
* “Guruji, ReactJS ke 5 interview Qs bhejo”

**Jai Mata Di 💥
Kafka ka dar gaya… Fullstack ne pakad liya!**
