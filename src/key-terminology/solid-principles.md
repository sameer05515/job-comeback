SOLID is an acronym representing five key design principles for object-oriented programming: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These principles, introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), aim to make software more understandable, flexible, maintainable, and reusable. 
Here's a breakdown of each principle:
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. In other words, a class should have one specific job or responsibility. 
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without altering existing code. 
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. Essentially, if a class A is a subtype of class B, you should be able to use objects of class A wherever you use objects of class B without breaking anything. 
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. This principle encourages the creation of smaller, more specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones. 
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This promotes loose coupling and makes code more flexible and maintainable. 
By following these principles, developers can create more robust and adaptable software systems.
