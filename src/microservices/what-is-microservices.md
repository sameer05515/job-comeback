**Microservices** are an architectural style where a large application is divided into small, independent services that communicate with each other using lightweight protocols (often HTTP/REST).

### Key Features:

* Each service is focused on a single business capability
* Services are independently deployable
* Each can be developed in different programming languages or tech stacks
* They communicate using APIs (usually REST, gRPC, messaging)

---

### Example in Java (Spring Boot):

**1. `product-service`** – handles product-related operations
**2. `order-service`** – handles order-related operations

They run on different ports, talk via REST APIs, and can scale independently.

---

### Benefits:

* Scalability
* Flexibility in technology
* Easier deployments
* Better fault isolation

---

### Common Tools:

* Spring Boot + Spring Cloud
* Eureka (Service Registry)
* Zuul/Gateway (API Gateway)
* Docker + Kubernetes (Deployment)
