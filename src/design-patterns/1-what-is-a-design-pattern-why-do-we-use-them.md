âœ… **Design Pattern** is a **reusable solution** to a common problem in software design. It provides a **proven structure** to solve design issues like object creation, communication, or structure.

### ðŸ”¹ Why Do We Use Design Patterns?

| Reason            | Benefit                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| âœ… Reusability     | Avoid reinventing solutions              |
| âœ… Maintainability | Cleaner, modular code                    |
| âœ… Communication   | Common language among developers         |
| âœ… Flexibility     | Easier to adapt/extend code              |
| âœ… Best practices  | Uses well-tested architectural decisions |

### ðŸ”¹ Example Patterns (GoF â€“ Gang of Four):

| Category       | Common Patterns                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Creational** | Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder       |
| **Structural** | Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Composite, Facade        |
| **Behavioral** | Strategy, Observer, Command, State, Template Method |

Let me know if you want Java examples for specific patterns like Singleton, Factory, Strategy, etc.
