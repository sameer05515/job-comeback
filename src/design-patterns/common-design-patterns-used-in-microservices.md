Here’s a **Microservices Design Patterns quick sheet** for interviews:

---

### **1️⃣ Decomposition Patterns**

* **By Business Capability** → Each service aligns with a domain (e.g., Orders, Payments).
* **By Subdomain (DDD)** → Based on *bounded contexts* in Domain-Driven Design.

---

### **2️⃣ Integration Patterns**

* **API Gateway** → Single entry point, handles routing, aggregation, auth.
* **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** → Custom APIs per frontend type (web, mobile).
* **Service Registry & Discovery** → Eureka, Consul, etc. for locating services dynamically.

---

### **3️⃣ Data Management Patterns**

* **Database per Service** → Each microservice has its own DB (avoids tight coupling).
* **Shared Database (anti-pattern)** → Avoid unless legacy constraints exist.
* **Saga Pattern** → Distributed transactions via choreography or orchestration.
* **CQRS** → Separate read and write models for scalability.

---

### **4️⃣ Reliability Patterns**

* **Circuit Breaker** → Stop cascading failures (Resilience4j, Hystrix).
* **Bulkhead** → Isolate service failures to prevent system-wide crashes.
* **Retry & Backoff** → Handle transient errors gracefully.
* **Fallback** → Provide default behavior when service is down.

---

### **5️⃣ Observability Patterns**

* **Centralized Logging** → ELK stack, Loki.
* **Distributed Tracing** → Jaeger, Zipkin.
* **Metrics Aggregation** → Prometheus, Grafana.

---

### **6️⃣ Deployment Patterns**

* **Blue-Green Deployment** → Zero downtime release by switching traffic.
* **Canary Release** → Gradually shift traffic to new version.
* **Sidecar Pattern** → Helper container for logging, proxy, etc. (e.g., Istio Envoy).

---

If you want, I can also give you **a diagram that maps these patterns into 3 layers: Service Layer, Data Layer, and Infrastructure Layer** so you can visualize them easily in interviews. That would make this even more memorable.
