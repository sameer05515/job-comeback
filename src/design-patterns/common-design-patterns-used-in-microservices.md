Here’s a **Microservices Design Patterns quick sheet** for interviews:

---

### **1️⃣ Decomposition Patterns**

* **By Business Capability** → Each service aligns with a domain (e.g., Orders, Payments).
* **By Subdomain (DDD)** → Based on *bounded contexts* in Domain-Driven Design.

---

### **2️⃣ Integration Patterns**

* **API Gateway** → Single entry point, handles routing, aggregation, auth.
* **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** → Custom APIs per frontend type (web, mobile).
* **Service Registry & Discovery** → Eureka, Consul, etc. for locating services dynamically.

---

### **3️⃣ Data Management Patterns**

* **Database per Service** → Each microservice has its own DB (avoids tight coupling).
* **Shared Database (anti-pattern)** → Avoid unless legacy constraints exist.
* **Saga Pattern** → Distributed transactions via choreography or orchestration.
* **CQRS** → Separate read and write models for scalability.

---

### **4️⃣ Reliability Patterns**

* **Circuit Breaker** → Stop cascading failures (Resilience4j, Hystrix).
* **Bulkhead** → Isolate service failures to prevent system-wide crashes.
* **Retry & Backoff** → Handle transient errors gracefully.
* **Fallback** → Provide default behavior when service is down.

---

### **5️⃣ Observability Patterns**

* **Centralized Logging** → ELK stack, Loki.
* **Distributed Tracing** → Jaeger, Zipkin.
* **Metrics Aggregation** → Prometheus, Grafana.

---

### **6️⃣ Deployment Patterns**

* **Blue-Green Deployment** → Zero downtime release by switching traffic.
* **Canary Release** → Gradually shift traffic to new version.
* **Sidecar Pattern** → Helper container for logging, proxy, etc. (e.g., Istio Envoy).

---

If you want, I can also give you **a diagram that maps these patterns into 3 layers: Service Layer, Data Layer, and Infrastructure Layer** so you can visualize them easily in interviews. That would make this even more memorable.

Here are some common design patterns used in microservices architecture:

1. **Decomposition Patterns**
   - Decompose by Business Capability
   - Decompose by Subdomain

2. **Data Management Patterns**
   - Database per Service
   - Shared Database
   - Saga
   - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
   - Event Sourcing

3. **Communication Patterns**
   - API Gateway
   - Backend for Frontend (BFF)
   - Circuit Breaker
   - Service Mesh
   - Service Registry

4. **Deployment Patterns**
   - Service Instance per Container
   - Service Instance per Host
   - Service Instance per VM
   - Sidecar
   - Ambassador
   - Adapter

5. **Observability Patterns**
   - Log Aggregation
   - Distributed Tracing
   - Application Metrics
   - Health Check API

6. **Security Patterns**
   - Access Token
   - JWT (JSON Web Token)
   - Secure Token Service (STS)
   - API Gateway Offloading
   - Container Security

7. **Resilience Patterns**
   - Retry
   - Timeout
   - Bulkhead
   - Fallback
   - Rate Limiting

8. **Transaction Management Patterns**
   - Transactional Outbox
   - Process Manager
   - Compensating Transaction

9. **Service Discovery Patterns**
   - Client-Side Discovery
   - Server-Side Discovery

10. **API Patterns**
    - API Versioning
    - Consumer-Driven Contracts

These patterns help address the challenges associated with building and maintaining microservices architectures.
