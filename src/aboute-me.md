Hello, I’m Premendra Kumar, with over 14 years of experience in Java, Spring Boot, and frontend using ReactJS.

I’ve contributed to end-to-end development of enterprise applications, played hybrid roles involving coding, mentoring and collaborating with product teams.

While I’ve mostly worked in IC roles, I’ve also supported team coordination, sprint planning, and onboarding of new members.

Currently, I’m looking for remote fullstack/lead opportunities where I can apply my experience and keep evolving with the latest Java + React ecosystem.
