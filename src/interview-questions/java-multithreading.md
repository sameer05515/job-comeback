Bilkul Prem bhaiya 🙏
Yeh rahe kuch **basic Java multithreading interview questions** — mostly asked in Java developer interviews, specially for 2–8 years experience.

### ✅ **Core Java Multithreading Questions**

#### 🔹 Basic Understanding

1. What is multithreading in Java?
2. What is the difference between `process` and `thread`?
3. How do you create a thread in Java?
4. What is the difference between extending `Thread` and implementing `Runnable`?
5. What are the different states of a thread in Java?

#### 🔹 Synchronization & Locks

6. What is synchronization in Java? Why is it needed?
7. Difference between `synchronized` method and `synchronized` block?
8. What is `volatile` keyword? How is it used?
9. What is `ReentrantLock`? How is it better than `synchronized`?
10. What is a **deadlock**? Can you explain with an example?

#### 🔹 Concurrency API

11. What is the `ExecutorService` in Java?
12. What is the difference between `execute()` and `submit()`?
13. What is `Callable` and how is it different from `Runnable`?
14. What is `Future` and how do you retrieve results from a thread?
15. What is `BlockingQueue` and how is it used in producer-consumer problem?

#### 🔹 Thread Utilities

16. What does `Thread.sleep()` do?
17. What is the difference between `wait()` and `sleep()`?
18. What is the difference between `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`?
19. What is `Thread.join()` and how does it work?
20. What is the role of `Thread.yield()`?

#### 🔹 Design Patterns / Real Use

21. How to implement **singleton pattern** in a thread-safe way?
22. Can you give a real-world example of using multithreading in your project?
23. What is `ThreadPoolExecutor`? How is it configured?
24. What is `CompletableFuture`? How is it better than `Future`?
25. How to handle thread exceptions?

### 🧠 Bonus: Coding Challenges to Prepare

* Print even/odd numbers using two threads
* Producer-consumer with `BlockingQueue`
* Deadlock example + how to avoid it
* Use `ExecutorService` to run multiple tasks
* Use `CompletableFuture` to run tasks in parallel and combine results

**Boliye bhaiya – agar mock interview script, coding practice set, ya real-world system design ke threading-based scenario chahiye to bataiye 🔥**
