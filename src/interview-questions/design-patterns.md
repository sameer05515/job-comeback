Here are **interview questions on Design Patterns** â€“ from basic to advanced, tailored for **Java/Spring Tech Lead or Senior Dev** roles:

---

### âœ… **Basic Level (2â€“4 YOE)**

1. [**What is a design pattern? Why do we use them?**](../design-patterns/1-what-is-a-design-pattern-why-do-we-use-them.md)
2. [**What is the difference between Factory and Abstract Factory pattern?**](../design-patterns/2-what-is-the-difference-between-factory-and-abstract-factory-pattern.md)
3. **Explain the Singleton pattern. How do you implement it in Java?**
4. **What is the use of the Builder pattern? Where is it used in Java?**
5. **Give a real-life example of the Adapter pattern.**
6. **What is the Observer pattern? Where is it used in UI frameworks?**
7. **How is the Decorator pattern different from inheritance?**
8. **What is the Strategy pattern? How would you use it to replace `if-else` chains?**
9. **Which design pattern is used in `java.util.Iterator`?**
10. **Explain the difference between composition and inheritance.**

### âœ… **Intermediate Level (4â€“7 YOE)**

11. **How does Spring use Proxy and Factory patterns internally?**
12. **How would you refactor a God Object using design patterns?**
13. **What is the Template Method pattern? How is it different from Strategy?**
14. **How is the Facade pattern useful in microservices architecture?**
15. **Give an example of the Chain of Responsibility in request handling.**
16. **When should you use Memento pattern vs a simple undo feature?**
17. **Explain the Open-Closed Principle with an example pattern.**
18. **How would you use the State pattern to model a UI toggle button?**
19. **What is a Command pattern? Give an example from Java GUI frameworks.**
20. **How does the Bridge pattern help in breaking class explosion due to multiple inheritance?**

21. **Which design pattern do you apply to decouple services in a distributed system?**
22. **How does Dependency Injection relate to design patterns?**
23. **What patterns would you use to implement a plugin architecture?**
24. **Explain how to apply the Observer pattern in an event-driven system (Kafka/RabbitMQ).**
25. **Can you combine patterns like Factory + Singleton? When and why?**
26. **How would you structure a large Spring Boot app using design patterns?**
27. **Explain difference between Proxy and Decorator with a real-world use case.**
28. **How to implement rate-limiting using design patterns?**
29. **Give examples of design patterns you have used in your recent project and why.**
30. **How do you balance readability vs design pattern purity in real-world code?**
