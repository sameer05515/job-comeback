Here's the SQL query to **count customers having duplicate `email` and duplicate `phone`** in the `customer` table:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM customer c
WHERE email IN (
    SELECT email
    FROM customer
    GROUP BY email
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND phone IN (
    SELECT phone
    FROM customer
    GROUP BY phone
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
```

### âœ… Explanation:

* First subquery finds `email`s that occur more than once.
* Second subquery finds `phone`s that occur more than once.
* The outer query filters `customer` records that match both conditions.

Let me know if you want to **list the actual duplicate records** instead of just count.
