✅ **Virtual DOM** in React is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the **real DOM**. It helps React efficiently update the UI without touching the actual DOM too often (which is slow).

---

### 🔹 **How It Works – Step by Step:**

1. **Initial Render:**

   * React creates a **Virtual DOM tree** from JSX/components
   * It renders this to the actual DOM for the first time

2. **State/Props Change:**

   * When something changes, React:

     * Creates a **new Virtual DOM**
     * **Diffs** it against the **previous Virtual DOM**

3. **Diffing Algorithm:**

   * React compares old vs new Virtual DOM
   * Figures out **minimal set of changes**

4. **Reconciliation:**

   * Applies **only the necessary updates** to the **real DOM**
   * This process is called **"reconciliation"**

### 🔹 ✅ Diagram Flow (Simplified):

```
Component JSX
    ↓
Virtual DOM (1)
    ↓ state/props update
Virtual DOM (2) ← diff → Virtual DOM (1)
    ↓
Patch real DOM (only minimal changes)
```

### ✅ Benefits:

* Faster than directly manipulating DOM
* Reduces performance bottlenecks
* Predictable re-render behavior

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "React's Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. It enables fast UI updates by diffing and applying only the minimal changes to the real DOM during re-render."
