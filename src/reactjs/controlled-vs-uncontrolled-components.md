✅ **Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components** in React refer to how form elements like `<input>` manage their state.

---

### 🔹 **Controlled Component**

* Form data is **handled by React state**
* Input value is bound to a **`useState`** variable
* Every change triggers a React **state update**

```jsx
const [name, setName] = useState("");

return (
  <input
    type="text"
    value={name}
    onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
  />
);
```

✅ Benefits:

* React is in full control of data
* Easy validation, conditionally enabling buttons, etc.

---

### 🔹 **Uncontrolled Component**

* Form data is **handled by the DOM**
* Uses **`ref`** to access input value directly

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();

const handleSubmit = () => {
  console.log(inputRef.current.value);
};

return <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />;
```

✅ Benefits:

* Less boilerplate
* Useful for **quick forms**, **file uploads**, etc.

### 🔹 ✅ Difference Table

| Feature             | Controlled               | Uncontrolled            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| State Managed By    | React (`useState`)       | DOM (`ref`)             |
| Access Value        | via `value` prop         | via `ref.current.value` |
| Re-render on change | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No                    |
| Validation Handling | Easy (with state)        | Manual (on DOM value)   |
| Preferred For       | Complex, validated forms | Simple, quick inputs    |

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "Controlled components rely on React state to manage form inputs, while uncontrolled components use DOM refs. Controlled is best for complex or validated forms; uncontrolled is better for simplicity or performance."
