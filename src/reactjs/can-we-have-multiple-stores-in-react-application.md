Yes, **you can technically have multiple stores** in a React application, **but it is generally discouraged** when using `redux` or `react-redux`.

---

### ✅ Why Avoid Multiple Stores?

* React Redux is designed to work with **a single store**.
* Multiple stores can lead to:

  * Loss of centralized state management.
  * Harder debugging and maintenance.
  * Complex communication between stores.

---

### ✅ Alternative (Recommended):

Use **multiple reducers** combined with `combineReducers` to split logic, but still have **one single store**.

```js
import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux';

const userReducer = (state = {}, action) => { /*...*/ };
const productReducer = (state = [], action) => { /*...*/ };

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
  products: productReducer
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
```

---

### ⚠️ If You Still Want Multiple Stores (Not Recommended):

```js
const store1 = createStore(reducer1);
const store2 = createStore(reducer2);

<Provider store={store1}>
  <ComponentUsingStore1 />
</Provider>

<Provider store={store2}>
  <ComponentUsingStore2 />
</Provider>
```

> ⚠️ React Redux context gets overwritten — not ideal for complex apps.

### ✅ Best Practice:

✔ One Redux store
✔ Use slices, combineReducers, and modular state

Let me know if you want example of modular slice-based Redux setup.
