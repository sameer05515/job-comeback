### ðŸ”¹ What is Virtual DOM in React?

The **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is a **lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM** used by React to optimize UI rendering.

---

### ðŸ”¹ How it works

1. **Initial Render**:

   * React builds a **virtual DOM tree** from your JSX.

2. **State/Props Change**:

   * React creates a **new virtual DOM** reflecting the updated UI.

3. **Diffing**:

   * React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one using a **diffing algorithm**.

4. **Minimal Updates**:

   * It calculates the **minimal set of changes** needed and applies them to the **real DOM** (called **reconciliation**).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why Virtual DOM?

* **Performance**: Direct manipulation of the real DOM is slow. React batches and minimizes real DOM updates.
* **Abstraction**: Developers focus on UI state, React handles efficient updates.

### ðŸ”¹ Analogy

> Think of the Virtual DOM like a draft version. React compares two drafts, finds differences, and then updates the final copy (the real DOM) efficiently.

### ðŸ”¹ Summary

| Feature  | Virtual DOM                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Location | In-memory (not visible in browser) |
| Speed    | Faster than real DOM operations    |
| Updates  | Batched and minimal                |
| Purpose  | Optimized UI rendering             |
