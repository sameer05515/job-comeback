# code to print only repeated values with occurence count>1 in given array
`const arr = [5, 4, 1, 7, 9, 5, 7, 8, 7];`

You can extend your code to filter and print only the keys with values > 1 like this:

```js
const arr = [5, 4, 1, 7, 9, 5, 7, 8, 7];

const occurrenceMap = {};

arr.forEach(m => {
  occurrenceMap[m] = (occurrenceMap[m] || 0) + 1;
});

Object.entries(occurrenceMap)
  .filter(([key, value]) => value > 1)
  .forEach(([key, value]) => {
    console.log(`Key: ${key}, Value: ${value}`);
  });
```

**Output:**

```
Key: 5, Value: 2
Key: 7, Value: 3
```

Do you want me to also give you a **one-liner ES6 `reduce` version** for interviews? That’s even cleaner.

#  a one-liner ES6 reduce version

Here’s a one-liner ES6 `reduce` version that prints only repeated values with `count > 1`:

```js
const arr = [5, 4, 1, 7, 9, 5, 7, 8, 7];

console.log(
  Object.entries(arr.reduce((a, v) => ((a[v] = (a[v] || 0) + 1), a), {}))
    .filter(([_, c]) => c > 1)
);
```

**Output**

```
[ [ '5', 2 ], [ '7', 3 ] ]
```

Do you want me to also give you a **Map-based one-liner**? That’s cleaner in interviews.

#  a **Map-based one-liner**

Here’s the **Map-based one-liner** version:

```js
const arr = [5, 4, 1, 7, 9, 5, 7, 8, 7];

console.log(
  [...arr.reduce((m, v) => m.set(v, (m.get(v) || 0) + 1), new Map())]
    .filter(([_, c]) => c > 1)
);
```

**Output**

```
[ [ 5, 2 ], [ 7, 3 ] ]
```

This approach is interview-friendly because `Map` preserves insertion order and avoids implicit string conversion of keys like plain objects do.
