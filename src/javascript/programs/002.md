# code to print only repeated values with occurence count>1 in given array
`const arr = [5, 4, 1, 7, 9, 5, 7, 8, 7];`

You can extend your code to filter and print only the keys with values > 1 like this:

```js
const arr = [5, 4, 1, 7, 9, 5, 7, 8, 7];

const occurrenceMap = {};

arr.forEach(m => {
  occurrenceMap[m] = (occurrenceMap[m] || 0) + 1;
});

Object.entries(occurrenceMap)
  .filter(([key, value]) => value > 1)
  .forEach(([key, value]) => {
    console.log(`Key: ${key}, Value: ${value}`);
  });
```

**Output:**

```
Key: 5, Value: 2
Key: 7, Value: 3
```

Do you want me to also give you a **one-liner ES6 `reduce` version** for interviews? Thatâ€™s even cleaner.
