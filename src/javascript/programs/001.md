# what will be output of (10+"1"-2)?

Let's break it down:

---

### âœ… Code:

```js
const aa = 10 + "1" - 2;
console.log(aa);
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ Step-by-step evaluation:

1. `10 + "1"`

   * `10` is a number
   * `"1"` is a string
   * `+` operator with number and string â‡’ **string concatenation**
   * Result: `"101"`

2. `"101" - 2`

   * `"101"` is a string, `2` is a number
   * `-` operator **forces numeric conversion**
   * `"101"` becomes `101`
   * `101 - 2 = 99`

---

### âœ… Final Output:

```js
99
```

```js
const aa=10+"1"/2;

console.log(aa);
```

```js

```

```js
const aa=10+"1"*2;

console.log(aa);
```
