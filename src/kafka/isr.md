Got it 👍 In **Apache Kafka**, **ISR (In-Sync Replica)** is an important concept related to replication and fault tolerance.

---

### 🔹 What is ISR?

* **ISR = In-Sync Replica**
* It’s the **set of replicas** (leader + followers) that are fully caught up with the **leader partition’s log**.
* Only replicas in ISR are considered "safe" for committing messages.

---

### 🔹 Example

Suppose a topic partition has 3 replicas:

* Leader: Broker 1
* Followers: Broker 2, Broker 3

If Broker 2 and Broker 3 are keeping up with Broker 1’s log (not lagging too much), then ISR = {1,2,3}.
If Broker 3 falls behind (slow or down), ISR = {1,2}.

---

### 🔹 Why ISR matters?

* When `acks=all` (or `acks=-1`), Kafka producer waits for the message to be **replicated to all ISR replicas** before acknowledging.
* Kafka **commits offsets** only when messages are safely replicated to ISR, ensuring **no data loss**.

---

### 🔹 Key Configurations

* **`replica.lag.time.max.ms`** → Max time a follower can lag behind the leader before being removed from ISR.
* **`min.insync.replicas`** → Minimum replicas (including leader) that must acknowledge a write for it to succeed.

### 🔹 Quick Comparison

| Term                          | Meaning                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Replica**                   | Copy of partition (Leader + Followers).      |
| **ISR**                       | Subset of replicas that are fully caught up. |
| **OSR** (Out-of-Sync Replica) | Replicas lagging behind → not in ISR.        |
| **Leader**                    | Handles reads/writes for the partition.      |
| **Follower**                  | Copies leader’s data.                        |

---

👉 In short:
**ISR = safe replicas in sync with leader** → ensures durability and consistency in Kafka.

Do you want me to also show how **ISR interacts with acks=1 vs acks=all** (with a small example timeline)?
