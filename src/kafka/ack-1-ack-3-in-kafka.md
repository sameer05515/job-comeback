Good question 👍 This is an **important Kafka interview topic**.
Let’s break down **Kafka producer `acks` settings**:

---

## 🔹 Kafka `acks` Setting

The producer config `acks` decides **when Kafka producer considers a write successful**.

### 1️⃣ `acks=1`

* The **leader broker** (partition leader) must **acknowledge** the write.
* **Followers (replicas)** don’t need to confirm.
* ✅ Pros: **Faster** (low latency).
* ❌ Cons: If the **leader crashes before followers replicate**, **data loss possible**.

---

### 2️⃣ `acks=all` (or `acks=-1`)

* The leader waits for **all in-sync replicas (ISR)** to confirm write.
* ✅ Pros: **Strong durability** (data written to multiple brokers).
* ❌ Cons: **Slower** (higher latency).
* If **min.insync.replicas > 1**, ensures at least that many brokers confirm.

---

### 3️⃣ (For completeness) `acks=0`

* Producer **does not wait** for any ack.
* ✅ Fastest (fire-and-forget).
* ❌ Highest risk of **message loss**.

## 🔹 Example Config

```java
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
props.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
props.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

// Choose acks
props.put("acks", "1");   // or "all"
```

---

## 🔹 Analogy 🎯

Think of **sending a registered parcel**:

* **acks=0** → You throw the parcel in the box, don’t care if it’s delivered.
* **acks=1** → Post office (leader) confirms receipt, but not yet delivered.
* **acks=all** → Post office + all branches (replicas) confirm, safe delivery guaranteed.

---

✅ In production:

* Use `acks=all` with `min.insync.replicas=2` for **high reliability**.
* Use `acks=1` when **performance > durability**.

Do you want me to also create a **side-by-side table (acks=0,1,all)** with **use cases** (like logging, payments, telemetry)?
