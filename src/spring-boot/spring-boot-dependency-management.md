# Tell me about Spring boot dependency management

In **Spring Boot**, *dependency management* means you don’t need to manually hunt for matching library versions — Boot does it for you.

---

## **Key Points**

1. **Uses Maven/Gradle BOM (Bill of Materials)**

   * Controlled by `spring-boot-dependencies` POM.
   * Defines a **curated list** of library versions tested to work together.

2. **Version-less Dependencies**

   * You add dependencies without specifying `<version>` (Maven) or version in Gradle.
   * Example (Maven):

     ```xml
     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
     </dependency>
     ```

3. **Override Versions**

   * Use `<dependencyManagement>` in Maven or `ext` in Gradle if you must override.
   * Example:

     ```xml
     <properties>
       <spring-boot.version>3.3.0</spring-boot.version>
       <jackson.version>2.15.2</jackson.version>
     </properties>
     ```

4. **Starters**

   * Boot provides *starters* (like `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`) that bundle common dependencies, so you add one starter instead of 5–6 libraries.

5. **Gradle**

   * Uses `io.spring.dependency-management` plugin for BOM import:

     ```gradle
     plugins {
       id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.1.4'
     }

     dependencyManagement {
       imports {
         mavenBom "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies:3.3.0"
       }
     }
     ```

✅ **In short for interviews:**
*Spring Boot dependency management* uses a BOM to provide **pre-tested, compatible versions** for all common libraries, letting you omit versions in most cases, and override them only if needed. It keeps your builds consistent and avoids “jar hell.”

If you want, I can also make you a **1-row table comparing Spring Boot Dependency Management vs Normal Maven dependency management** for quick recall in interviews. Would you like me to do that?
