Here’s a clean interview-ready answer:

---

### ✅ **What is Spring Boot?**

**Spring Boot** is a framework built on top of the **Spring Framework** that simplifies the development of **standalone, production-ready Spring applications**.

It provides:

* **Auto-configuration** (no need for boilerplate XML/Java config)
* **Embedded server** (like Tomcat, Jetty — no WAR deployment)
* **Opinionated defaults** for app setup
* Built-in support for **metrics**, **health checks**, and **externalized config**

### ✅ **Spring Boot vs Spring Framework**

| Feature              | Spring Framework             | Spring Boot                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Configuration        | Manual (XML/Java-based)      | Auto-configured                          |
| Server               | External deployment (WAR)    | Embedded (Tomcat/Jetty)                  |
| Setup Time           | More setup needed            | Faster startup with sensible defaults    |
| Production Readiness | Manual setup                 | Built-in Actuator endpoints              |
| Starter Dependencies | Manual dependency management | `spring-boot-starter-*` simplifies setup |
| Learning Curve       | Steeper for new projects     | Simplified for rapid development         |

### ✅ Summary Line for Interviews:

> "Spring Boot makes it easy to create production-ready Spring applications with minimal configuration, while the Spring Framework is the foundation offering flexible, fine-grained control."
