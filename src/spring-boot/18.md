# As a spring boot developer having 8+ years of experience, What are technical challenges you have observed and how you have handled them?

Here are some common **technical challenges** faced by experienced Spring Boot developers (8+ years level), along with ways I’ve handled them:

---

### 1. **Microservice-to-Microservice Communication**

**Challenge:**
Managing inter-service communication, timeouts, and fallbacks in distributed systems.

**Solution:**

* Used **Feign clients** with **Hystrix** (older) or **Resilience4j** for circuit breaking.
* Centralized error handling and retry mechanisms.
* Used **Spring Cloud Gateway** for routing and load balancing.

---

### 2. **Managing Large Codebases**

**Challenge:**
Maintaining readability and modularity in large Spring Boot applications.

**Solution:**

* Followed **modular architecture** using layered structure (controller → service → repository).
* Split domains into multiple maven/gradle modules when needed.
* Applied **SOLID** and **design patterns** (Builder, Factory, Strategy).

---

### 3. **Performance Bottlenecks**

**Challenge:**
Slow APIs due to DB calls or blocking I/O.

**Solution:**

* Analyzed with **Spring Actuator**, logs, and profilers.
* Used **caching (Spring Cache + Redis)** for frequently read data.
* Switched to **asynchronous calls** using `@Async` and `CompletableFuture` for non-blocking behavior.

---

### 4. **Database Versioning & Migration**

**Challenge:**
Keeping DB schema in sync across environments.

**Solution:**

* Used **Flyway** or **Liquibase** for schema versioning.
* Enforced **rollback-able scripts** and environment-specific properties.

---

### 5. **Security Concerns**

**Challenge:**
Managing role-based access and secure token-based authentication.

**Solution:**

* Used **Spring Security + JWT** for stateless token validation.
* Implemented **method-level security** (`@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`).
* Integrated with **OAuth2 providers** (Google, GitHub).

---

### 6. **Handling Configuration Across Environments**

**Challenge:**
Sensitive values hardcoded or mismanaged between dev/test/prod.

**Solution:**

* Externalized configs using `application-{profile}.properties`.
* Stored secrets in **Vault** or **AWS Parameter Store**.
* Used **Spring Cloud Config** for centralized configuration.

---

### 7. **Error Handling and Logging**

**Challenge:**
Hard-to-debug exceptions and inconsistent logging.

**Solution:**

* Centralized exception handling using `@ControllerAdvice`.
* Used **SLF4J** with **Logback** and log correlation IDs.
* Integrated with **ELK** or **Graylog** for centralized logs.

---

### 8. **Unit and Integration Testing**

**Challenge:**
Testing Spring components in isolation and with mocks.

**Solution:**

* Used **Mockito** for mocking service/repo layers.
* Used **`@SpringBootTest` + Testcontainers** for integration testing.
* Wrote **contract tests** for APIs using RestAssured and OpenAPI.
