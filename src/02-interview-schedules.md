## Sopra Steria

Bhai, ye toh ekdum **interview recap / notes** lag raha hai 👌. Main isko ek **short + to-the-point cheat sheet** bana deta hoon taaki aap revise kar sako aur interview me confident ho jao.

---



### React / Frontend

* **50 child components, 1 component change → prevent others re-render**

  * Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`
  * Proper key usage
  * State ko granular break karo, unnecessary props pass mat karo.

* **When Context vs Redux?**

  * **Context** → small apps, theme, auth, language (lightweight, no boilerplate).
  * **Redux** → large apps, complex state, async flows, predictable debugging (DevTools, middleware).

* **Error Boundary**

  * Class component with `static getDerivedStateFromError` & `componentDidCatch`.
  * Catches **render, lifecycle, constructor errors** in child tree.
  * Useful when 3rd-party component crashes → isolate & prevent whole app crash.

---

### Java / Backend

* **ClassNotFoundException vs NoClassDefFoundError**

  * `ClassNotFoundException` → checked, class not found at runtime when explicitly loaded (`Class.forName`).
  * `NoClassDefFoundError` → error, class available at compile but missing at runtime.

* **Implicit methods in any class**

  * `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `clone()`, `finalize()`, `getClass()`, `notify()`, `wait()`, etc. (from `Object`).

* **Why wait/notify in Object, not Thread?**

  * Because threads synchronize on an **object’s monitor lock**.
  * Lock belongs to object, so wait/notify logically fit in `Object`.

* **Java 8 Features**

  * Lambdas, Streams, Functional interfaces, Optional, Default & static methods in interfaces, Date/Time API, CompletableFuture, Collectors.

* **Composition vs Aggregation**

  * **Composition** → Strong HAS-A, lifecycle bound (Engine inside Car).
  * **Aggregation** → Weak HAS-A, independent lifecycles (Library & Books).

* **SOLID Principles**

  * S → Single Responsibility
  * O → Open/Closed
  * L → Liskov Substitution
  * I → Interface Segregation
  * D → Dependency Inversion

* **Open/Closed Principle**

  * Classes open for extension, closed for modification.
  * Example: Use inheritance/interfaces instead of modifying existing class.

* **Liskov Substitution Principle**

  * Subclass should be replaceable for parent without breaking behavior.
  * Example: Rectangle vs Square violation.

---

### Security

* **OAuth**

  * Open standard for delegated authorization.
  * Access without sharing credentials.
  * Example: Login with Google, Facebook.

* **Add Spring Security in Spring Boot**

  * Add `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency.
  * By default: all endpoints secured with Basic Auth.
  * Customize via `SecurityFilterChain` or extending `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` (till Spring 2.6).

---

### Hibernate

* **N+1 Problem**

  * 1 query for parent, N queries for children.
  * Fix → `fetch join`, `EntityGraph`, batch fetching.

---

### Git

* **Rebase vs Merge**

  * Merge → preserves history, adds merge commit.
  * Rebase → rewrites history, cleaner linear commits.
  * Use rebase for local feature branches, merge for shared branches.

---

### Spring

* **DI vs IoC**

  * **IoC (Inversion of Control)** → Framework controls object lifecycle.
  * **DI (Dependency Injection)** → One form of IoC, dependencies injected by container (constructor, setter, field).

---




---

## ✅ Code Review me kya check karte ho?

* **Readability & Maintainability**

  * Proper naming conventions, small methods, meaningful variables.
  * No deep nesting, proper comments (only where required).

* **Code Quality**

  * No duplicate code.
  * Follows SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles.

* **Error Handling & Logging**

  * Proper exception handling (no silent catches).
  * Logs with correct log level (info/warn/error).

* **Performance**

  * Avoid unnecessary loops, queries, memory leaks.
  * Use caching if needed.

* **Security**

  * Input validation, SQL Injection prevention, secure API calls.

* **Tests & Coverage**

  * Unit tests, integration tests exist.
  * Coverage threshold (like >80%).

* **Style Guide / Standards**

  * Follows project coding guidelines (Java/React lint rules, Prettier).

---

## ✅ JUnit & Related Tools

* **JUnit**

  * Core for writing unit tests in Java.
  * Assertions (`assertEquals`, `assertThrows`), lifecycle (`@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`).

* **Mockito**

  * Mock dependencies → isolate unit under test.

* **Cobertura / JaCoCo**

  * Code coverage analysis.
  * % of lines/branches tested.

* **Cucumber (BDD)**

  * Gherkin syntax: `Given-When-Then`.
  * For behavior-driven tests (business readable).

* **Frontend Testing**

  * **Jest** → JS unit tests (snapshot, async tests).
  * **Vitest** → Faster, modern alternative to Jest (works well with Vite + React).

---

## ✅ SonarQube

* **Static code analysis tool**.
* Checks for:

  * Bugs, Vulnerabilities, Code Smells.
  * Duplications, Coverage %, Maintainability index.
* Integrates with CI/CD (Jenkins, GitLab, GitHub Actions).
* Enforces **Quality Gates** before merge.

---

👉 Interview me direct bolna:
*"Code review me main readability, maintainability, error handling, performance, security aur tests pe focus karta hoon. JUnit ke sath Mockito use karta hoon, coverage ke liye JaCoCo/Cobertura, BDD ke liye Cucumber. Frontend me Jest/Vitest use kiya hai. Static analysis ke liye SonarQube integrate karke quality gates enforce karte hain."*

---

Kya chahte ho main iska ek **side-by-side table (Backend Tools vs Frontend Tools vs Static Analysis)** bana dun taaki aur crisp lage interviews me?
