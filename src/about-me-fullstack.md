### 🧑‍💻 **About Me – Full Stack Developer (Java + ReactJS)**

---

Hi,
I’m Premendra Kumar. I completed my B.Tech. from BCE Bhagalpur in 2009. I started my career as a Java developer.

I have 8+ years of full-stack development experience using Java, Spring Boot, microservices and ReactJS.

My last company was Zycus Infotech, where I worked as a Senior Software Engineer on the ESG Lythouse project. I developed REST APIs for the GMI and EU Taxonomy modules and integrated them with the frontend. I completed these tasks within tight deadlines and received rewards and recognition for my work.

I have completed certifications in Java 8, Spring Boot, ReactJS, Spring Security (JWT), Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions.

I enjoy working on scalable enterprise applications, mainly using Spring Boot and ReactJS functional components. I follow clean code practices and focus on performance and maintainability.

While I have mostly worked as an individual contributor, I’ve also handled sprint planning, team collaboration, and mentoring.

My long-term goal is to become a Software Architect, building high-impact systems with clean and scalable architecture.

In my free time, I like to explore new technologies, travel, and meet new people.
