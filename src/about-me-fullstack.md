### üßë‚Äçüíª **About Me ‚Äì Full Stack Developer (Java + ReactJS)**

I am a passionate and performance-driven **Full Stack Developer** with over **8 years of experience** in developing scalable enterprise applications using **Java (Spring Boot)** and **ReactJS**, and an overall **14+ years of expertise** in backend systems.

I‚Äôve actively contributed to **microservices-based projects**, where I built robust REST APIs following clean code practices and integrated them seamlessly with modern frontend interfaces using ReactJS functional components.

While I have primarily worked in **individual contributor (IC)** roles, I‚Äôve also taken on responsibilities like **sprint planning**, **team collaboration**, and **mentoring new members**.
At **Zycus Infotech**, I played a key role in the **ESG Lythouse** project, delivering end-to-end functionality in a full-stack environment.

I hold certifications in **Java 8, ReactJS, Spring Security (JWT), Docker, Kubernetes**, and **GitHub Actions** ‚Äî and I constantly strive to stay ahead by exploring new tools and frameworks.

My long-term vision is to grow into a **Software Architect** role, contributing to high-impact systems with clean architecture and scalable design.

In my free time, I love to explore new technologies, travel, and connect with like-minded professionals.
