✅ **Functional Interface** = An interface that has **exactly one abstract method** (SAM – Single Abstract Method).
It’s the foundation of **lambda expressions** in Java 8.

---

### 🔹 Characteristics:

* Can have **default** and **static** methods
* Marked with `@FunctionalInterface` (optional but recommended)

---

### 🔹 Common Built-in Examples:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Comparator<T> {
    int compare(T o1, T o2);
}
```

---

### 🔹 ✅ Custom Functional Interface Example:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyOperation {
    int operate(int a, int b);
}
```

### 🔹 Usage with Lambda:

```java
MyOperation add = (a, b) -> a + b;
System.out.println(add.operate(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

---

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "A functional interface has one abstract method and enables lambda expressions. Java 8 provides built-in ones like Runnable, Function, Predicate, and also lets you define custom ones."

✅ **`@FunctionalInterface`** is a **marker annotation** introduced in Java 8 to indicate that an interface is intended to be a **functional interface** (i.e., it must have **exactly one abstract method**).

---

### 🔹 **Purpose:**

* Ensures the interface **can be used with lambda expressions**
* **Compiler enforces** that only **one abstract method** exists
* Prevents accidental addition of extra abstract methods

---

### 🔹 ✅ Example:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculator {
    int operate(int a, int b);

    default void log(String msg) {
        System.out.println("LOG: " + msg);
    }
}
```

✅ This compiles because only **one abstract method** is present

---

### 🔹 ❌ Invalid Functional Interface:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Broken {
    void method1();
    void method2(); // ❌ Compile error: More than one abstract method
}
```

---

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "`@FunctionalInterface` ensures an interface has exactly one abstract method so it can be safely used with lambda expressions. It helps the compiler catch errors early."
