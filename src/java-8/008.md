✅ **`forEach()` vs Traditional Loop** in Java:

---

### 🔹 **forEach()** (Java 8 Stream & Collection method)

```java
List<String> names = List.of("Prem", "Amit");

names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
```

* Uses **lambda expression**
* **Declarative style**
* Works on **Streams and Collections**
* **Can't break/continue** like traditional loops

---

### 🔹 **Traditional Loop**

```java
for (String name : names) {
    if (name.equals("Prem")) break;
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

* Uses **imperative style**
* Can use **`break` / `continue`**
* More **flexible** for complex logic
* Slightly more **verbose**

### 🔹 ✅ Key Differences Table:

| Feature            | `forEach()`                    | Traditional Loop                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Style              | Declarative                    | Imperative                      |
| Syntax             | Shorter, uses lambda           | Verbose                         |
| Control Flow       | ❌ No `break` / `continue`      | ✅ Supports both                 |
| Use in Streams     | ✅ Yes                          | ❌ No                            |
| Parallel Execution | ✅ Easy with `parallelStream()` | ❌ Manual thread handling needed |

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "`forEach()` is a cleaner, functional-style iteration introduced in Java 8, but traditional loops offer more control for complex flow like breaking or skipping elements."
