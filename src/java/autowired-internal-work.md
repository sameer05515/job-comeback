Hereâ€™s how `@Autowired` works **internally in Spring** (clean breakdown for interviews):

---

### âœ… What is `@Autowired`?

* It's an annotation that tells **Spring to inject a bean** (dependency) automatically.
* Can be used on:

  * **Constructor**
  * **Setter method**
  * **Field**

---

### âœ… Internal Working (Step-by-Step)

#### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Component Scan + Bean Registration**

When Spring initializes, it scans classes with:

```java
@Component / @Service / @Repository / @Controller
```

and registers them as beans in the **ApplicationContext**.

#### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Dependency Resolution via BeanFactory**

Spring uses `BeanFactory` / `ApplicationContext` to:

* Track all available beans
* Resolve dependencies by **type** (`@Autowired`) or **name** (`@Qualifier`)

#### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Post-Processing with `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`**

Internally, Spring uses:

```java
AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor
```

* It implements `BeanPostProcessor`
* It reflects over all beans after creation
* It checks for `@Autowired` annotations
* Injects dependencies via:

  * Constructor
  * Setter
  * Direct field access (using reflection)

#### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Object Graph Build**

Spring recursively satisfies dependencies of dependencies (nested injection)
Forms the full **object graph** in memory

### âœ… Constructor Injection Example

```java
@Component
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository repo;

    @Autowired
    public UserService(UserRepository repo) {
        this.repo = repo;
    }
}
```

ðŸ”¹ Spring:

* Finds `UserService` as a component
* Sees it requires `UserRepository`
* Looks up `UserRepository` bean
* Injects it via constructor

---

### âœ… Extra Tips for Interviews

* `@Autowired` injects by **type**
* Combine with `@Qualifier` to resolve ambiguity
* Can set `@Autowired(required = false)` to make it optional
* Spring Boot uses constructor injection by default for better testability and immutability
