Here’s how `@Autowired` works **internally in Spring** (clean breakdown for interviews):

---

### ✅ What is `@Autowired`?

* It's an annotation that tells **Spring to inject a bean** (dependency) automatically.
* Can be used on:

  * **Constructor**
  * **Setter method**
  * **Field**

---

### ✅ Internal Working (Step-by-Step)

#### 🔹 1. **Component Scan + Bean Registration**

When Spring initializes, it scans classes with:

```java
@Component / @Service / @Repository / @Controller
```

and registers them as beans in the **ApplicationContext**.

#### 🔹 2. **Dependency Resolution via BeanFactory**

Spring uses `BeanFactory` / `ApplicationContext` to:

* Track all available beans
* Resolve dependencies by **type** (`@Autowired`) or **name** (`@Qualifier`)

#### 🔹 3. **Post-Processing with `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`**

Internally, Spring uses:

```java
AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor
```

* It implements `BeanPostProcessor`
* It reflects over all beans after creation
* It checks for `@Autowired` annotations
* Injects dependencies via:

  * Constructor
  * Setter
  * Direct field access (using reflection)

#### 🔹 4. **Object Graph Build**

Spring recursively satisfies dependencies of dependencies (nested injection)
Forms the full **object graph** in memory

---

### ✅ Constructor Injection Example

```java
@Component
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository repo;

    @Autowired
    public UserService(UserRepository repo) {
        this.repo = repo;
    }
}
```

🔹 Spring:

* Finds `UserService` as a component
* Sees it requires `UserRepository`
* Looks up `UserRepository` bean
* Injects it via constructor

---

### ✅ Extra Tips for Interviews

* `@Autowired` injects by **type**
* Combine with `@Qualifier` to resolve ambiguity
* Can set `@Autowired(required = false)` to make it optional
* Spring Boot uses constructor injection by default for better testability and immutability

### ✅ `BeanFactory` vs `ApplicationContext` in Spring

| Feature                         | `BeanFactory`                            | `ApplicationContext`                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Type**                        | Core container interface                 | Sub-interface of `BeanFactory`        |
| **Eager vs Lazy**               | Lazy instantiation by default            | Eager instantiation by default        |
| **Internationalization (i18n)** | ❌ Not supported                          | ✅ Supported                           |
| **Event Handling**              | ❌ Not supported                          | ✅ Built-in event mechanism            |
| **BeanPostProcessor, Aware**    | ❌ Not handled automatically              | ✅ Detected & registered automatically |
| **Context Aware**               | ❌ No support                             | ✅ Supports `ApplicationContextAware`  |
| **Use Case**                    | Lightweight containers, resource-limited | Most used in real-world Spring apps   |

---

### 🔹 Example

```java
// BeanFactory
BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(new FileSystemResource("beans.xml"));

// ApplicationContext
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
```

---

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "`ApplicationContext` is a more feature-rich container than `BeanFactory`, providing support for i18n, event propagation, and automatic bean post-processing — making it the standard choice in most Spring applications."
