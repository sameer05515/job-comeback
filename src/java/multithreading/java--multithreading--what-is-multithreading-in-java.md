**Multithreading in Java** is a programming technique where **multiple threads (smaller units of a process)** run **concurrently** to perform tasks independently and efficiently.

---

### âœ… Definition:

> **Multithreading** is the ability of a Java program to **execute two or more threads simultaneously**, enabling **concurrent execution** of tasks within a single process.

---

### âœ… Example Use Cases:

* Background tasks like sending emails
* File downloads/uploads
* UI updates while processing data
* Real-time games or chat apps

---

### âœ… How to Create Thread in Java:

1. **By extending `Thread` class**
2. **By implementing `Runnable` interface**
3. **By using `ExecutorService` / Thread pool**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example: Using `Runnable`

```java
public class MyTask implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyTask());
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

### âœ… Key Benefits of Multithreading

| Benefit                 | Description                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| âœ… Efficient CPU Usage   | Utilizes idle CPU cycles                |
| âœ… Faster Execution      | Parallel execution of independent tasks |
| âœ… Better Responsiveness | UI doesnâ€™t freeze on long tasks         |

---

### ðŸ”š TL;DR:

> **Multithreading = multiple tasks running in parallel threads inside a single JVM process**. Java provides strong support via `Thread`, `Runnable`, and `java.util.concurrent`.
