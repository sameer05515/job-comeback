Bilkul Prem bhaiya 🙏
Aaiye **Java Synchronization** ko samjhte hain — clear, interview-focused aur real-world touch ke saath ✅

---

### ✅ What is Synchronization in Java?

> **Synchronization** in Java is a mechanism to **control access to shared resources by multiple threads**, ensuring **data consistency and thread safety**.

---

### 🧠 Why is it Needed?

When **multiple threads** access the **same object/resource**:

* They may **interfere with each other**
* Leading to **race conditions**, **dirty reads**, or **inconsistent data**

🔐 Synchronization ensures that **only one thread** can access the **critical section** at a time.

---

### 🔧 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine 2 people trying to **withdraw from the same ATM account** at the same time.
If synchronization is missing — **balance may become negative**!

---

### 🔹 Java Synchronization Techniques

| Technique                  | Description                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `synchronized` method      | Locks the entire method for one thread   |
| `synchronized` block       | Locks only a specific part of code       |
| `static synchronized`      | Locks on class-level (Class object)      |
| `ReentrantLock` (advanced) | Explicit locking control (more flexible) |

---

### 🔸 Example: Without Synchronization (Race Condition)

```java
class Counter {
    int count = 0;
    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
```

Multiple threads calling `increment()` may give **wrong result**.

---

### ✅ Example: With Synchronization

```java
class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++; // now thread-safe
    }
}
```

OR

```java
public void increment() {
    synchronized (this) {
        count++;
    }
}
```

---

### 📌 Important Points

* Only **one thread** can execute a `synchronized` block on a given object at a time.
* Prevents **thread interference** and **memory inconsistency errors**.
* Can cause **performance issues** if overused — use wisely.

---

### 🔚 TL;DR:

> **Synchronization = Thread safety mechanism**
> Ensures **only one thread accesses shared data at a time**, preventing bugs caused by concurrent access.

**Boliye Prem bhaiya – aage `ReentrantLock vs synchronized`, ya ek `bank account simulation` wala example bana doon?**
