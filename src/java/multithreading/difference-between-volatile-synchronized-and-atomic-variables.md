# What is difference between volatile, synchronized and atomic variables

Here’s a crisp **Java concurrency cheat table** for `volatile`, `synchronized`, and `atomic` variables:

---

| Feature         | `volatile`                                                     | `synchronized`                                                        | `Atomic` (e.g. `AtomicInteger`)                                                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Ensures **visibility** of changes to variables across threads. | Ensures **mutual exclusion** + **visibility** (atomicity + ordering). | Provides **lock-free thread-safe operations** on single variables.              |
| **Atomicity**   | ❌ No — only visibility guaranteed.                             | ✅ Yes — all code inside the block executes atomically.                | ✅ Yes — for provided operations (`incrementAndGet()`, `compareAndSet()`, etc.). |
| **Locks used**  | None                                                           | Monitor lock                                                          | None (uses CAS – Compare-And-Swap)                                              |
| **Performance** | Faster (no locking)                                            | Slower (locking overhead)                                             | Faster than `synchronized` (but limited to single-variable ops)                 |
| **Scope**       | Variable-level (only for reads/writes)                         | Code block or method                                                  | Single variable or object reference                                             |
| **When to use** | For flags, simple state updates without compound actions.      | For complex critical sections involving multiple steps/variables.     | For counters, accumulators, and simple atomic updates.                          |
| **Example**     |                                                                |                                                                       |                                                                                 |

```java
volatile boolean flag = true;
```

```java
synchronized void update() { ... }
```

````java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.incrementAndGet();
``` |

💡 **Quick Rules**  
- `volatile` → **visibility only** (no race condition protection for multiple-step operations).  
- `synchronized` → **visibility + atomicity** (slower, but works for complex operations).  
- `Atomic` → **visibility + atomicity** for **single variable updates** without locks (uses CPU instructions).

# what is Atomicity in multithreading context?

In **multithreading**, **Atomicity** means an operation is performed **as a single, indivisible step** — either it completes entirely or not at all, with **no chance for other threads to see it in an intermediate state**.

---

### **Key Points**

* **Atomic operation** = No other thread can observe partial changes.
* Prevents *race conditions* without needing explicit synchronization (in some cases).
* Examples of atomic operations in Java:

  * `volatile` read/write for primitive types (except `long` & `double` before Java 8)
  * `AtomicInteger.incrementAndGet()`
  * Assigning a reference variable
* **Non-atomic example**: `counter++` is **not** atomic — it’s actually:

  1. Read value
  2. Increment
  3. Write value
     (Other threads can interleave during steps 1–3.)

---

### **Example**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class AtomicExample {
    private static AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                count.incrementAndGet(); // atomic
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task);
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + count); // Always 2000
    }
}
```

Here, `incrementAndGet()` is **atomic**, so no race condition occurs.

If you want, I can give you a **table comparing Atomicity, Visibility, and Ordering** — that’s often asked in concurrency interviews. It’ll make this concept much clearer.
