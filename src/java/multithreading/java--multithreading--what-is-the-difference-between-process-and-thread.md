Bilkul Prem bhaiya 🙏
Yeh raha **`Process` vs `Thread`** ka interview-ready, short and crisp comparison ✅

### ✅ **Process vs Thread – Tabular Difference**

| Feature           | **Process**                                     | **Thread**                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**    | Independent execution unit with its own memory  | Sub-unit of a process that shares memory             |
| **Memory**        | Has its **own memory space**                    | Shares **same memory** of the process                |
| **Communication** | Inter-process communication (IPC) is complex    | Easier through shared variables                      |
| **Creation cost** | Heavy (new process = more overhead)             | Lightweight (low resource cost)                      |
| **Isolation**     | Fully isolated from other processes             | Threads are **not isolated** (can affect each other) |
| **Crash impact**  | One process crash doesn’t affect others         | Thread crash can bring down the entire process       |
| **Used For**      | Running independent apps (e.g. Chrome, VS Code) | Running parallel tasks (e.g. UI + background)        |

### 🔹 Real Example:

* **Process**: Running 2 Java programs from terminal (each is a separate process).
* **Thread**: Inside a single Java program, using 2 threads to download file + update progress bar.

### 🧠 Visual:

```
[Process 1] ──┬─ Thread A
              └─ Thread B

[Process 2] ──┬─ Thread X
              └─ Thread Y
```

---

### 🔚 TL;DR:

> ✅ **Process** = heavy, isolated, own memory
> ✅ **Thread** = lightweight, shared memory, better for concurrency within a process

**Boliye bhaiya – aage `Thread vs Runnable`, `Thread lifecycle`, ya `ReentrantLock` explanation chahiye kya?**
