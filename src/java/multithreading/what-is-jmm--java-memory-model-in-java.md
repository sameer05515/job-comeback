You mean **JMM** = **Java Memory Model** (not "module").

### **Java Memory Model (JMM)**

The **Java Memory Model** defines **how Java threads interact through memory** â€” specifically:

* **How variables are stored in memory**
* **How changes by one thread become visible to others**
* **The rules for reordering instructions**

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Main Memory & Working Memory**

   * **Main Memory**: Shared between all threads (heap, static fields, etc.)
   * **Working Memory**: Each thread has its own local copy of variables (in CPU cache/registers).
   * Threads **donâ€™t directly read/write main memory** â€” they work on local copies and sync back.

2. **Visibility Problem**

   * Without synchronization, one threadâ€™s changes might not be visible to others immediately.

3. **Reordering**

   * JVM and CPU can reorder instructions for optimization â€” unless synchronization primitives prevent it.

4. **Happens-Before Relationship**

   * JMM defines that **if action A happens-before action B**, then:

     * All writes by A are visible to B.
     * Ordering is guaranteed.

---

### **How JMM Achieves This**

* **`volatile`** â€” forces read/write from main memory (visibility)
* **`synchronized`** â€” ensures visibility + atomicity via memory barriers
* **`final`** â€” safe publication guarantees if properly constructed
* **`java.util.concurrent`** classes â€” built with JMM rules

---

### **Example of Visibility Problem**

```java
class Example {
    boolean flag = false;

    void writer() {
        flag = true; // Thread 1
    }

    void reader() {
        if (flag) { // Thread 2 might never see true without sync
            System.out.println("Flag is true");
        }
    }
}
```

If `flag` is not `volatile` or accessed in a synchronized block, Thread 2 **might never see** the update.

---

ðŸ“Œ **In short:**
JMM ensures **correct communication between threads** and prevents unexpected results due to **CPU caching, compiler optimizations, and instruction reordering**.
