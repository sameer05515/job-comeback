# what is difference between wait, sleep and join

Here’s a **quick interview-friendly comparison** of `wait()`, `sleep()`, and `join()` in Java:

| Feature             | `wait()`                                                                                                  | `sleep()`                                                               | `join()`                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Package**         | `java.lang.Object`                                                                                        | `java.lang.Thread`                                                      | `java.lang.Thread`                                                         |
| **Purpose**         | Makes the current thread **wait** until another thread notifies it (used for inter-thread communication). | Pauses the current thread for a specified time without releasing locks. | Makes the current thread **wait** until another thread finishes execution. |
| **Lock release**    | ✅ Releases the monitor lock                                                                               | ❌ Does **not** release any lock                                         | ❌ Does **not** release any lock                                            |
| **Where to call**   | Inside a synchronized block/method (on the monitor object)                                                | Anywhere                                                                | On a `Thread` object                                                       |
| **Throws**          | `InterruptedException`                                                                                    | `InterruptedException`                                                  | `InterruptedException`                                                     |
| **Who wakes it up** | `notify()` / `notifyAll()` or interruption                                                                | Time expires or interruption                                            | When the joined thread terminates or interruption                          |
| **Overloads**       | `wait()`, `wait(long)`, `wait(long,int)`                                                                  | `sleep(long)`, `sleep(long,int)`                                        | `join()`, `join(long)`, `join(long,int)`                                   |

### **Example snippets**

```java
// wait()
synchronized (lock) {
    lock.wait(); // releases lock, waits for notify
}

// sleep()
Thread.sleep(1000); // pauses 1 second, keeps lock if held

// join()
Thread t = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Task done"));
t.start();
t.join(); // waits until t finishes
```

If you want, I can also prepare a **memory trick** to remember these differences for interviews in under 10 seconds. Would you like that?
