There is **no fixed default value** for `serialVersionUID`.

---

### 🔧 If not explicitly defined:

Java **automatically generates** a `serialVersionUID` at runtime using internal logic based on the **class name, interfaces, fields, methods, modifiers**, etc.

> It uses the `ObjectStreamClass.computeDefaultSUID()` algorithm.

---

### ⚠️ Problem:

This **generated UID is not stable**. Even small changes (e.g., renaming a method or adding a field) will change it — breaking backward compatibility during deserialization.

---

### ✅ Best Practice:

Always declare it manually to ensure version compatibility:

```java
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
```

---

### 📌 Summary:

* No constant "default" value.
* JVM computes it if missing.
* It's safer to **explicitly define** it.
