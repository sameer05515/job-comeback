If `serialVersionUID` is **not defined explicitly** in a `Serializable` class:

---

### üîß Java will **generate it automatically** at runtime

Based on the class‚Äôs **structure** (fields, methods, etc.).

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Consequences

#### ‚úÖ Works fine when:

* Class structure hasn't changed between **serialization and deserialization**.

#### ‚ùå Fails when:

* Even a **minor change** (like adding/removing a field or method) is made to the class after serialization.

**Then:**

```text
java.io.InvalidClassException: 
ClassName; local class incompatible: 
stream classdesc serialVersionUID = 1234567890, local class serialVersionUID = 987654321
```

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practice

Always declare `serialVersionUID` manually:

```java
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
```

This ensures compatibility across different versions of the class.

---

### TL;DR

If `serialVersionUID` is not defined, your code becomes fragile to class structure changes ‚Üí may lead to runtime exceptions during deserialization.
