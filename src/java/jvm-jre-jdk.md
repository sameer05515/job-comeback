Here’s a clean interview-style breakdown of **JVM vs JRE vs JDK**:

---

### ✅ **1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**

* **Runs your `.class` files**
* Converts **bytecode to machine code** at runtime
* It is **platform-dependent**

**Main roles:**

* Loads class files
* Verifies bytecode
* Executes code via JIT (Just-In-Time compiler)
* Handles memory, GC, threads

📌 *It does **not contain development tools or libraries**.*

---

### ✅ **2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**

* Contains **JVM + Libraries + Runtime Classes**
* Used to **run Java applications**
* No compiler or dev tools

🧩 Includes:

```
JVM + rt.jar + core libraries + bin/
```

📌 *Good for **end-users** who just want to run `.jar` apps.*

---

### ✅ **3. JDK (Java Development Kit)**

* Full package: **JRE + compiler + dev tools**
* For **developing, compiling, debugging** Java apps

🧰 Includes:

```
JRE + javac + javadoc + jar + jshell + tools.jar
```

📌 *Required for developers to **write and build** Java code.*

### ✅ Summary Table

| Feature                      | JVM | JRE | JDK |
| ---------------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Runs `.class` bytecode       | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |
| Compiles `.java` to `.class` | ❌   | ❌   | ✅   |
| Includes development tools   | ❌   | ❌   | ✅   |
| Includes JVM                 | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |
| Includes libraries           | ❌   | ✅   | ✅   |

### 🎯 Interview Line:

> JVM is the engine, JRE is the vehicle to run Java apps, and JDK is the factory where we build those vehicles.

Reply with:

* `versions` → difference between JDK 8, 11, 17
* `java-compiler-flow` → flow from .java to execution
* `memory-areas` → JVM memory model and garbage collection
*
