# **ConcurrentHashMap vs. synchronizedMap** comparison

Hereâ€™s a crisp **ConcurrentHashMap vs. synchronizedMap** comparison for interviews:

| Feature              | **ConcurrentHashMap**                                                                                      | **Synchronized Map** (`Collections.synchronizedMap()`)                                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Thread Safety**    | Thread-safe using **fine-grained locking** (segments/buckets).                                             | Thread-safe using **a single lock** for the whole map.                                             |
| **Concurrency**      | Multiple threads can read and write **concurrently** to different buckets.                                 | Only **one thread** can read/write at a time. Others block.                                        |
| **Performance**      | High performance in multi-threaded access due to reduced contention.                                       | Lower performance under heavy concurrency due to full-map lock.                                    |
| **Null Keys/Values** | **No null keys** allowed, null values allowed.                                                             | Allows **one null key** and multiple null values (like HashMap).                                   |
| **Iteration Safety** | Iterator is **fail-safe** (wonâ€™t throw `ConcurrentModificationException`, may reflect concurrent updates). | Iterator is **fail-fast** (throws `ConcurrentModificationException` if modified during iteration). |
| **Use Case**         | High-concurrency, large maps, frequent reads/writes.                                                       | Low concurrency, simpler needs, small maps.                                                        |

ðŸ’¡ **Rule of Thumb for Interviews**

* **Low concurrency** â†’ `Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>())`
* **High concurrency** â†’ `ConcurrentHashMap`

Do you want me to make you a **Java code demo** showing both in action with multiple threads so you can explain with an example in interviews?
