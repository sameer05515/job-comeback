# **ConcurrentHashMap vs. synchronizedMap** comparison

Here‚Äôs a crisp **ConcurrentHashMap vs. synchronizedMap** comparison for interviews:

| Feature              | **ConcurrentHashMap**                                                                                      | **Synchronized Map** (`Collections.synchronizedMap()`)                                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Thread Safety**    | Thread-safe using **fine-grained locking** (segments/buckets).                                             | Thread-safe using **a single lock** for the whole map.                                             |
| **Concurrency**      | Multiple threads can read and write **concurrently** to different buckets.                                 | Only **one thread** can read/write at a time. Others block.                                        |
| **Performance**      | High performance in multi-threaded access due to reduced contention.                                       | Lower performance under heavy concurrency due to full-map lock.                                    |
| **Null Keys/Values** | **No null keys** allowed, null values allowed.                                                             | Allows **one null key** and multiple null values (like HashMap).                                   |
| **Iteration Safety** | Iterator is **fail-safe** (won‚Äôt throw `ConcurrentModificationException`, may reflect concurrent updates). | Iterator is **fail-fast** (throws `ConcurrentModificationException` if modified during iteration). |
| **Use Case**         | High-concurrency, large maps, frequent reads/writes.                                                       | Low concurrency, simpler needs, small maps.                                                        |

üí° **Rule of Thumb for Interviews**

* **Low concurrency** ‚Üí `Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>())`
* **High concurrency** ‚Üí `ConcurrentHashMap`

Do you want me to make you a **Java code demo** showing both in action with multiple threads so you can explain with an example in interviews?

# a Java code demo showing both (`Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>())` and `ConcurrentHashMap`) in action with multiple threads so you can explain with an example in interviews

Here‚Äôs a **side-by-side multi-threading demo** for `Collections.synchronizedMap()` vs `ConcurrentHashMap` that you can run and show in interviews.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class MapThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

        // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Synchronized Map
        Map<String, Integer> syncMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());

        // 2Ô∏è‚É£ ConcurrentHashMap
        Map<String, Integer> concurrentMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

        System.out.println("=== Testing SynchronizedMap ===");
        runTest(syncMap);

        System.out.println("\n=== Testing ConcurrentHashMap ===");
        runTest(concurrentMap);
    }

    private static void runTest(Map<String, Integer> map) throws InterruptedException {
        Runnable writer = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                map.put(Thread.currentThread().getName() + "-" + i, i);
            }
        };

        Runnable reader = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                // With synchronizedMap, we must manually synchronize during iteration
                synchronized (map) {
                    for (String key : map.keySet()) {
                        // Simulate read
                        map.get(key);
                    }
                }
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(writer, "Writer-1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(writer, "Writer-2");
        Thread t3 = new Thread(reader, "Reader-1");

        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();

        t1.start(); t2.start(); t3.start();
        t1.join();  t2.join();  t3.join();

        long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("Final size: " + map.size() + ", Time taken: " + (end - start) + " ms");
    }
}
```

### üîç Interview Notes

| Feature       | `Collections.synchronizedMap()`           | `ConcurrentHashMap`                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Thread Safety | Achieved by synchronizing all map methods | Achieved by segmenting & fine-grained locking             |
| Iteration     | Must manually synchronize                 | Fail-safe iterator (no `ConcurrentModificationException`) |
| Performance   | Slower under high concurrency             | Much faster under high concurrency                        |
| Use Case      | Low concurrency or legacy code            | High concurrency, modern apps                             |

If you want, I can also **add artificial delays** in writes/reads to make the difference more obvious in console output for interviews. That way you can visually show how `ConcurrentHashMap` is faster. Would you like me to add that?
