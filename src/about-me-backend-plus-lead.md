### 🧑‍💼 **About Me – Backend Developer & Team Lead**

I am a seasoned **Backend Developer and Team Lead** with over **14 years of experience** in building high-performance enterprise applications using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Microservices architecture**. My focus has consistently been on delivering **clean, scalable, and maintainable code**, aligned with SOLID principles and design best practices.

For the past **8 years**, I’ve also embraced **full-stack development**, actively working with **ReactJS** and modern UI technologies to deliver seamless end-to-end solutions.

I have successfully led and mentored teams in delivering quality code, conducting peer reviews, driving sprint planning, and onboarding new members. At **Zycus Infotech**, I contributed to the **ESG Lythouse** project, where I developed secure REST APIs and integrated them into ReactJS frontends, while also coordinating with stakeholders and QA teams to ensure successful delivery.

My backend expertise spans **Java 8+, Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, REST, MongoDB, MySQL**, and **asynchronous processing** with tools like **Spring Batch** and **basic Kafka**. I’ve also worked with **GraphQL**, CI/CD pipelines (**Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**), and containerization tools (**Docker**, **Kubernetes**).

I hold multiple certifications in **Java 8, ReactJS, Spring Security, Docker, Kubernetes**, and aim to transition into a **Software Architect** role — where I can combine my backend leadership and architectural vision to drive impactful solutions.

In my free time, I love to explore new technologies, travel, and connect with like-minded professionals.
