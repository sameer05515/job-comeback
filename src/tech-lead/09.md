### ✅ How I Handle Conflict Between Two Senior Developers Over Tech Decisions

---

### 🔹 1. **Acknowledge and Create a Safe Space**

* I ensure both feel **heard without bias**
* Set a neutral tone: *“Let’s focus on what’s best for the system, not who’s right.”*

✅ *The goal is collaboration, not competition.*

---

### 🔹 2. **Clarify the Problem and Options**

* Ask each dev to clearly explain:

  * Their preferred approach
  * The reasoning behind it (performance, maintainability, scalability, etc.)
* List the pros and cons **together on a whiteboard or shared doc**

---

### 🔹 3. **Bring It Back to Facts and Context**

* Tie each solution to:

  * Project **goals** and **timelines**
  * **System requirements** (NFRs like latency, throughput, etc.)
  * **Team maturity** and long-term **maintainability**

✅ *I reframe from “what’s best technically” to “what’s best for this context.”*

---

### 🔹 4. **Invite a Third Perspective (if needed)**

* Loop in:

  * Architect
  * Product lead (if timelines are a factor)
  * External reference (benchmark, docs, prior decisions)

---

### 🔹 5. **Drive Toward Consensus or Compromise**

* Use decision drivers:

  * Data over opinion
  * Short-term + long-term balance
  * Ease of rollback/failure recovery
* If needed, split the decision:

  * POC now, revisit in Phase 2
  * Go with one plan but track the risks of the other

---

### 🔹 6. **Document Decision + Why**

* Write a Decision Record:

  * What options were considered
  * Why this one was picked
  * Who was involved
  * Risk/rollback plan

---

### 🔹 7. **Follow Up After Implementation**

* Did it solve the problem well?
* What did we learn?
* Were concerns of both parties addressed?

✅ *Keeps future debates constructive instead of personal.*

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "I handle senior dev conflicts by grounding the discussion in context, data, and shared goals—driving toward consensus or compromise while preserving respect and documenting the decision transparently."
