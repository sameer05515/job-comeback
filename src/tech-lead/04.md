### ✅ How I Conduct Technical Reviews of Architecture Proposals

---

### 🔹 1. **Understand the Context First**

* What is the **business goal** or **problem**?
* Functional + non-functional requirements (scalability, latency, cost, etc.)
* Stakeholders: internal teams, external users, partners?

---

### 🔹 2. **Break the Proposal into Review Areas**

| Area                      | What I Review                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏗️ Architecture Style    | Monolith, Microservices, Event-driven, etc.         |
| 🔌 APIs & Integration     | Contracts, REST/GraphQL, versioning, idempotency    |
| 🧠 Domain Design          | Domain modeling, bounded contexts, service split    |
| 🗄️ Data Layer            | DB choices (SQL/NoSQL), indexing, migrations        |
| ☁️ Infra & Deployment     | CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud readiness          |
| ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools     | Are they justified? Is it over-engineered?          |
| 🔒 Security               | AuthN, AuthZ, OWASP, data encryption                |
| 🛠️ Observability         | Logs, metrics, alerts, tracing                      |
| 📈 Scalability & Failover | Load handling, retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers |
| 💰 Cost Awareness         | Cloud spend, licensing, maintenance effort          |

---

### 🔹 3. **Ask Questions & Challenge Assumptions**

* Why was this approach picked?
* What alternatives were considered?
* How does it fail under pressure/load?
* What trade-offs are made (simplicity vs flexibility, cost vs speed)?

---

### 🔹 4. **Review Diagrams (HLD, Sequence, DB schema)**

* Are the data flows clear?
* Is the system too coupled?
* Any SPOFs (single point of failures)?
* Is the flow observability-friendly?

---

### 🔹 5. **Evaluate for Long-Term Fit**

* Will this scale for 2x, 10x usage?
* How hard is onboarding new devs into this system?
* Is it testable, debuggable, deployable?

---

### 🔹 6. **Give Constructive Feedback**

* Suggest improvements, not just problems
* Balance pragmatism with best practices
* Note high-risk areas vs low-hanging fixes

---

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "I review architecture by validating design against business goals, scalability, and maintainability—checking tech stack, API contracts, data handling, and deployment strategies, while providing actionable feedback."

Type:

* `architecture-review-template` → get a checklist template
* `microservices-review-guide` → if system is microservice-based
* `hld-sample-review` → review sample high-level diagram
