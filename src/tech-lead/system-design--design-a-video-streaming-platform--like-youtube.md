✅ Here's a comprehensive **System Design for a Video Streaming Platform (like YouTube)**
Focus: 🎥 **Uploading**, 🧬 **Encoding**, 🌐 **CDN**, 🏷 **Metadata**, 🤖 **Recommendations**

---

## 🧭 1. **Core Features**

* Upload and store videos
* Transcode into multiple formats/resolutions
* Stream videos via CDN
* Store video metadata and stats
* Show personalized recommendations
* Scalable to millions of users

---

## ⚙️ 2. **High-Level Architecture**

```
           [Client Web/Mobile]
                    ↓
         ┌──────[API Gateway]──────┐
         ↓                        ↓
 [Upload Service]         [Playback Service]
         ↓                        ↓
[Object Storage (S3)] ← [CDN + Edge Nodes]
         ↓
[Transcoder Service (FFmpeg/Bento4)]
         ↓
 [Video Versions Store + Metadata DB]
         ↓
 [Search / Recommendation Engine]
```

---

## 🎬 3. **Video Upload Flow**

1. User uploads video via frontend.
2. Frontend gets **pre-signed URL** from Upload Service.
3. Uploads video directly to **S3 (or blob store)**.
4. Notifies Upload Service via webhook or callback.
5. Video enters **encoding queue**.

---

## 🧬 4. **Transcoding Pipeline (Encoding)**

* Worker pool (FFmpeg, AWS Elastic Transcoder, GCP Transcoder API)
* Create multiple resolutions:
  `144p`, `360p`, `480p`, `720p`, `1080p`, `4K`

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=1280:720 -c:v libx264 output_720.mp4
```

* Output saved to S3 in folders like:

```
/videoId/720p.mp4  
/videoId/480p.mp4
/videoId/manifest.m3u8  ← for HLS playback
```

---

## 🌐 5. **CDN for Video Streaming**

* Use CloudFront, Akamai, or Cloudflare
* Edge servers cache videos closer to users
* Segment video files into chunks (e.g. HLS/DASH)

> 🔥 Reduces buffering, supports adaptive bitrate streaming

---

## 📑 6. **Metadata Storage**

Use relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB):

### `videos` table

| Field        | Description               |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| id           | UUID                      |
| title        | Text                      |
| description  | Text                      |
| user\_id     | Uploader                  |
| upload\_time | Timestamp                 |
| duration     | Float                     |
| views        | Integer                   |
| tags         | Array / Full Text Indexed |
| status       | Uploaded/Processing/Live  |

---

## 📊 7. **Analytics & Stats**

* Count views, likes, watch time
* Redis / Kafka for real-time ingestion
* Store in OLAP DB (e.g., ClickHouse, BigQuery)

---

## 🔍 8. **Search & Recommendations**

* Use **ElasticSearch** or **Meilisearch** for full-text search
* Recommendation Engine:

  * Collaborative filtering
  * Trending by region
  * User watch history
  * Popularity buckets (views, watch time)
* Store user watch behavior in event stream (Kafka)

---

## 🔐 9. **Security & Privacy**

* Signed URLs for private/unlisted content
* DRM for premium content (Widevine/FairPlay)
* Rate limiting and token-based access to APIs
* Moderation: flag/report, auto ML classifiers

---

## 🗃️ 10. **Tech Stack Example**

| Component             | Technology                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Upload / Playback API | Node.js / Spring Boot         |
| Storage               | Amazon S3 / GCP Cloud Storage |
| Encoding              | FFmpeg / Elastic Transcoder   |
| CDN                   | CloudFront / Cloudflare       |
| Metadata DB           | PostgreSQL / MongoDB          |
| Queue                 | Kafka / RabbitMQ              |
| Search                | Elasticsearch                 |
| Recommendations       | ML model + Redis Cache        |
