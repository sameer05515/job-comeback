### âœ… Steps I Follow When a Production Issue is Reported

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Acknowledge & Categorize**

* Confirm receipt of the issue (with severity)
* Categorize: blocker, major, minor, intermittent

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Reproduce Quickly (if possible)**

* Use logs, error message, or user steps
* Try to reproduce in:

  * Local dev
  * Staging/UAT (if data available)
  * Production (read-only)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Check Logs & Monitoring Tools**

* Use:

  * **Logs** (ELK, CloudWatch, etc.)
  * **APM** (New Relic, Datadog, etc.)
  * **Actuator** endpoints if Spring Boot
* Look for: stack traces, timeouts, memory spikes, external failures

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Check Recent Deployments**

* Review recent git commits or CI/CD pipelines
* Rollback candidate? Hotfix needed?

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Fix / Patch Safely**

* If root cause is known:

  * Prepare patch
  * Validate via test cases or staging
  * Get approval for hotfix release

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Deploy & Monitor**

* Deploy fix to production
* Closely monitor for:

  * Error drop
  * Performance improvement
  * User confirmation (if applicable)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Post-Mortem & Root Cause Analysis**

* RCA document covering:

  * What broke
  * Why it broke
  * How it was fixed
  * Preventive action

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. **Prevent Recurrence**

* Add:

  * Test cases (unit/integration)
  * Health checks, alerts
  * Better error handling/logs
  * Circuit breakers if needed

---

### âœ… Summary Line for Interview:

> "When a production issue arises, I quickly confirm, investigate via logs/monitoring, reproduce, fix safely, deploy, and do RCA with preventive actions to ensure long-term stability."
