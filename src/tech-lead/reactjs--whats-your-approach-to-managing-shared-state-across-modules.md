âœ… Here's a clear and interview-ready answer to:
**"What's your approach to managing shared state across modules?"**

## ðŸ”„ **Approach Overview**

Managing shared state across modules requires balancing **global accessibility**, **performance**, and **modularity**. Here's my layered approach:

---

### âœ… 1. **Local State First (via `useState`, `useReducer`)**

> Keep state close to where it's used.

* Component-specific data (form input, toggle) stays local.
* Reduces unnecessary global re-renders.

---

### âœ… 2. **Global State via Store (Redux Toolkit / Zustand / Jotai)**

> For **cross-feature** shared state like:

* Auth/User session
* Theme settings
* Notifications
* Cart/Checkout data

ðŸ’¡ I prefer:

* **Redux Toolkit** for enterprise-scale apps with middleware needs
* **Zustand** for minimal & scalable stores with less boilerplate

---

### âœ… 3. **React Context API (for lightweight state)**

> For static/shared context like:

* Theme/Locale
* Auth context (currentUser, logout)

ðŸš« Avoid using Context for frequently updated data (can cause deep re-renders).

---

### âœ… 4. **Module Isolation with Shared Hooks**

> Wrap shared logic in reusable hooks:

```js
function useCart() {
  const cart = useStore((s) => s.cart);
  const addToCart = useStore((s) => s.addItem);
  return { cart, addToCart };
}
```

Each module uses only what it needs â€” clean separation with shared access.

---

### âœ… 5. **Memoization & Selector Patterns**

> To prevent re-renders:

* Use `useSelector` + `shallowEqual` in Redux
* Use Zustand selectors or React.memo in components

---

### âœ… 6. **Persistence & Sync**

* Store shared state in `localStorage` or `IndexedDB` if needed (e.g., cart/session)
* Sync tabs via storage event or use packages like `broadcast-channel`

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

| Scope        | State Tool                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Local        | `useState`, `useReducer`         |
| Shared/light | `Context + custom hooks`         |
| Global/data  | `Redux Toolkit`, `Zustand`       |
| Side Effects | `Redux Thunk/Saga`, `useEffect`  |
| Persistence  | `localStorage`, `sessionStorage` |
