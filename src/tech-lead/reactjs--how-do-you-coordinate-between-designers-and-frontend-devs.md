✅ Here's an interview-ready answer to:
**"How do you coordinate between designers and frontend developers?"**

---

## 🤝 **My Coordination Approach**

### ✅ 1. **Start with Shared Understanding**

* Kick off each feature with a **joint walkthrough** of designs (Figma, Zeplin, etc.)
* Clarify behavior for edge cases, responsiveness, accessibility, interactions

---

### ✅ 2. **Use Design Tokens / Component Libraries**

* Promote consistency via **design tokens** (colors, spacing, typography)
* Align on **reusable components** using:

  * Storybook or Figma component libraries
  * Shared design systems (like Material UI / Chakra / Tailwind standards)

---

### ✅ 3. **Feedback Loop**

* Use **Figma comments** or async tools (Slack, Linear, Jira) for design feedback
* Encourage designers to **inspect** and annotate variants (hover, mobile, empty state)

---

### ✅ 4. **Design-to-Code Bridge**

* Leverage tools like:

  * **Figma Inspect** for exact CSS/spacing
  * **Zeroheight** or **Storybook** for dev-design sync
* Maintain shared UI kits and story-driven components in code

---

### ✅ 5. **Prototyping + Early Demos**

* Share in-progress builds early for visual review
* Validate fonts, colors, transitions, spacing before merging

---

### ✅ 6. **Accessibility & UX Checks**

* Discuss alt text, tab order, motion preferences
* Build with WCAG in mind (or guide designers if needed)

---

### ✅ 7. **Retros & Post-Sprint Feedback**

* Discuss what worked/didn’t in terms of design handoff
* Suggest changes in Figma organization or dev-ready assets
