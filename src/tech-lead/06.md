### âœ… My Process for Planning a Refactor or Rewrite

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Define the Why (Clear Justification)**

* Performance issues?
* Hard to maintain or extend?
* Tech debt slowing down delivery?
* Migration to a new stack or architecture?

âœ… *I always ensure it ties to a business value or future scalability need.*

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Set Goals & Scope**

* What must stay the same (e.g., APIs, DB)?
* What are we trying to improve (e.g., readability, testability)?
* Is this a **refactor** (internal change only) or a **rewrite** (new design)?

âœ… *Avoid "big-bang rewrites" unless truly necessary.*

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Understand the Existing System**

* Read the code and related docs
* Identify hot spots (bugs, complexity, duplication)
* Gather feedback from users and devs ("whatâ€™s hard to work with?")

âœ… *Use tools like SonarQube or code coverage to guide efforts.*

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Break into Phases**

* **Phase 1:** Isolate and test legacy logic
* **Phase 2:** Rewrite/refactor in modular pieces
* **Phase 3:** Switch gradually (feature flag or parallel run)
* **Phase 4:** Clean up and remove deprecated code

âœ… *Keeps risk low and feedback loop tight.*

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Write Tests Before Refactoring**

* Add unit/integration tests if missing
* Capture current behavior (especially edge cases)
* Prevents regression during change

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Plan Resources & Timeline**

* Sync with PM/team to reserve capacity
* Avoid mid-sprint changes unless critical
* Prioritize refactor tasks like features (with story points)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Review & Validate Each Step**

* Get peer reviews after each module
* Monitor logs, metrics, or bugs post-deploy
* Validate performance and correctness

---

### âœ… Summary Line for Interview:

> "I plan a refactor/rewrite by clearly scoping the goal, analyzing legacy code, writing safety tests, and executing in small, testable phasesâ€”always aligned with business value."
