### ✅ How I Ensure Knowledge Sharing and Avoid Silos

---

### 🔹 1. **Encourage a “Share First” Culture**

* Promote open discussions during standups and retros
* Appreciate developers who document, explain, or demo things
* Normalize “I don’t know, let’s find out together”

✅ *Knowledge is team power—not individual currency.*

---

### 🔹 2. **Document Actively and Accessibly**

* Use Notion, Confluence, or internal wikis
* Keep docs lightweight but useful:

  * Project setup
  * Service diagrams
  * API contracts
  * Common pitfalls
* Use README files in each repo for quick context

---

### 🔹 3. **Run Internal Knowledge Sharing Rituals**

| Ritual               | Frequency  | Purpose                            |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 👩‍🏫 Tech Talks     | Biweekly   | Share tools, patterns, lessons     |
| 💡 Lightning Demos   | Weekly     | Demo new features or spike results |
| 🧠 Pair Programming  | Ad hoc     | Spread context and patterns        |
| 🔄 Rotation On Tasks | Per sprint | Cross-train across code areas      |

---

### 🔹 4. **Enforce Ownership but Avoid Isolation**

* Each feature has an owner, but **never a gatekeeper**
* Use shared Slack channels or story grooming sessions for visibility
* Encourage questions like: *"Who else can make changes here?"*

---

### 🔹 5. **Leverage Code Reviews as Learning Moments**

* Reviews are a two-way street:

  * Reviewer explains why
  * Author learns better practices
* Tag juniors in reviews to expose them to new parts of the system

---

### 🔹 6. **Create Fallback and Backup Plans**

* Always have **2+ devs aware** of every module
* Maintain “Bus Factor ≥ 2”
* Add checklist items like: *"Is this feature documented?"* before closing a story

---

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "I prevent knowledge silos by promoting a culture of shared ownership, lightweight documentation, regular demos, rotation of responsibilities, and using code reviews as a learning tool."
