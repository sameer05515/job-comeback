✅ Here’s a complete **System Design for a Job Scheduler (Cron-as-a-Service)** — think **cron + distributed queue + retry + worker orchestration**.

> 🕑 Focus: **Task Queue**, 🗃 **Persistence**, 🔁 **Retries**, 🧩 **Worker Coordination**

---

## 🧭 1. **Core Features**

* Schedule jobs at specific times/intervals (like `cron`)
* Persist jobs & status in DB
* Support one-time and recurring tasks
* Workers should pick & execute jobs reliably
* Retry on failure
* Horizontal scalability & fault tolerance

---

## 🧱 2. **High-Level Architecture**

```
             [API Client / UI]
                     ↓
               [Scheduler API]
                     ↓
     ┌─────────── Persistent Store ───────────┐
     │     [Jobs DB]       [Logs DB]          │
     └────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     ↓
            [Job Dispatcher Loop] (cron scanner)
                     ↓
              [Task Queue (Kafka/SQS)]
                     ↓
              [Worker Pool] → Execute → Log result
```

---

## 📅 3. **Job Definition Schema**

```json
{
  "job_id": "UUID",
  "schedule": "0 9 * * *",      // cron format
  "type": "HTTP/Script",
  "payload": {
    "url": "https://example.com/api",
    "method": "POST",
    "body": { ... }
  },
  "retries": 3,
  "status": "SCHEDULED/FAILED/COMPLETED",
  "next_run": "2025-06-24T09:00:00Z",
  "created_at": "...",
  "updated_at": "..."
}
```

---

## 🧠 4. **Scheduler Loop (Cron Scanner)**

* Runs every minute
* Scans DB for jobs where:

```sql
next_run <= NOW() AND status = 'SCHEDULED'
```

* Pushes job execution events to a **queue** (Kafka/SQS/Redis)

---

## 📨 5. **Task Queue**

Use: **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, **SQS**, or **Redis Streams**

* Topic: `scheduled_jobs`
* Partitioned by job\_id (for FIFO)
* Acts as buffer between scheduler & workers

---

## ⚙️ 6. **Worker Design**

Each worker:

* Subscribes to queue
* Picks job → executes (HTTP request / script)
* Handles **timeouts, retries, circuit breakers**
* On success/failure → logs status

---

## 🔄 7. **Retries & Failures**

* Store retry count with job
* On failure → requeue with backoff
* Max retries → mark as FAILED
* Use **DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)** for permanent failures

---

## 🧵 8. **Worker Coordination**

* Use Redis-based lock (`SETNX`) if workers share DB access
* Or partition jobs based on `job_id % N_WORKERS`
* Ensure **only one worker executes one job instance**

---

## 🗃️ 9. **Database Tables**

### 🔹 `jobs`

| Field         | Type     | Description                 |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| id            | UUID     | Primary Key                 |
| schedule      | String   | Cron format                 |
| payload       | JSON     | Task details                |
| next\_run     | DateTime | Next scheduled execution    |
| retries\_left | Int      | Remaining retries           |
| status        | Enum     | SCHEDULED, RUNNING, DONE... |

---

### 🔹 `job_logs`

| Field        | Description             |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| job\_id      | Reference to `jobs`     |
| timestamp    | When executed           |
| status       | SUCCESS / FAILURE       |
| duration\_ms | How long it took        |
| result       | Output or error message |

---

## 🔐 10. **Security**

* API key auth for users
* Input validation for job payload
* Rate limiting for scheduling API
* Access control on job log history

---

## 🧪 11. **Advanced Features**

| Feature        | Description                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| One-time jobs  | Schedule task at specific time    |
| Recurring jobs | Cron-like interval                |
| Pause/Resume   | Update job state                  |
| Retry Policies | Exponential backoff, max attempts |
| Parallelism    | Configure max concurrent jobs     |
| Webhooks       | Notify on job success/failure     |
