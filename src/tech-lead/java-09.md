### âœ… My Strategy to Handle Breaking Changes in APIs

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Follow Semantic Versioning for APIs**

Use versioning to isolate breaking changes:

* `/api/v1/users`
* `/api/v2/users` (new structure, logic, or contract)

âœ… Keeps old consumers working while new ones migrate gradually.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Deprecate, Don't Delete Immediately**

* Mark old fields or endpoints as `@Deprecated`
* Add warnings in API response headers or logs
* Provide **sunset timelines** (e.g., "v1 will be removed in 90 days")

âœ… Gives consumers time to migrate safely.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Backward Compatibility by Default**

* Use **optional fields** instead of removing required ones
* Add new endpoints instead of changing response structure
* Donâ€™t change data types or semantics of existing fields

```json
// Safe addition
{
  "userId": 123,
  "name": "Prem",
  "email": "prem@example.com",
  "newField": "optionalValue"
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Contract Testing**

Use tools like:

* **Spring Cloud Contract**
* **Pact**

âœ… Validates producer and consumer expectations so that a change is caught **before release**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Communicate Early and Clearly**

* Notify downstream consumers via changelogs, release notes, or Slack/email
* Share migration guides if the change is large
* Use OpenAPI / Swagger diff tools to track changes

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Feature Flags for API Behavior**

For internal consumers:

* Add toggles to serve old/new behavior conditionally
* Gradually flip the feature flag

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Test Across Versions**

* Maintain integration tests for **both old and new versions**
* Keep post-deploy monitoring for 4xx/5xx spikes after rollout

---

### âœ… Summary Line for Interview:

> "I handle breaking changes using versioned endpoints, backward-compatible design, contract testing, and phased deprecation with clear communicationâ€”ensuring safe evolution of APIs without breaking clients."

Type:

* `breaking-change-checklist` â†’ step-by-step migration safety
* `api-versioning-template` â†’ boilerplate for v1/v2 structure
* `contract-test-sample` â†’ Spring Cloud Contract starter setup
