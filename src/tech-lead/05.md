### ✅ How I Prioritize Tech Debt in a Product-Driven Environment

---

### 🔹 1. **Classify Tech Debt into Types**

| Type                  | Example                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 🛠️ Code Debt         | Hardcoded values, duplication, poor design |
| 🧱 Architectural Debt | Wrong module boundaries, tight coupling    |
| 🐌 Performance Debt   | Inefficient queries, memory leaks          |
| ❌ Testing Debt        | No test coverage, flaky tests              |
| 📦 Infra Debt         | Manual deployment, outdated dependencies   |

---

### 🔹 2. **Use Impact-Based Prioritization**

I tag each debt item by:

| Factor             | Example                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🚨 Risk            | Can it break prod? Cause bugs?                 |
| 🐢 Velocity Impact | Slows new feature dev? Complicates onboarding? |
| 📉 User Experience | Affects performance or reliability?            |
| 💸 Cost            | Leads to infra/resource waste?                 |

Score using **High / Medium / Low** or numeric weight.

### 🔹 3. **Embed It Into Product Roadmap**

* Pitch debt fixes as **"enablers"** to features:

  > "Refactoring this will reduce dev time for next 3 sprints"
* Bundle minor debt with related feature stories
* Reserve capacity (e.g. **15–20% of every sprint**) for debt

---

### 🔹 4. **Track It Visibly**

* Maintain in backlog with clear titles + tags (e.g. `#tech-debt`)
* Link each item to a story/user pain when possible
* Make it visible in sprint planning and retrospectives

---

### 🔹 5. **Pick Your Battles Strategically**

* Fix high-risk, high-friction debt first
* Avoid wasting time on low-impact cosmetic refactors
* Use events like:

  * Major releases
  * Onboarding new devs
  * Performance incidents

---

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "I prioritize tech debt by assessing business risk, dev velocity impact, and user experience. I make it visible, trackable, and integrate fixes with product roadmaps to maintain delivery speed and code health."
