### ✅ How I Perform RCA (Root Cause Analysis) & Communicate to Stakeholders

---

### 🔹 1. **Gather Facts Quickly**

* What failed? When? Who reported it?
* Impact: which users/systems were affected?
* Source: logs, alerts, dashboards, incident timeline

---

### 🔹 2. **Reproduce or Isolate the Issue**

* Try to replicate issue locally/staging
* Narrow down to:

  * Code bug
  * Infra issue (DB, network, memory)
  * Third-party failure
  * Misconfiguration or deployment

---

### 🔹 3. **Identify Root Cause**

* Use tools like:

  * **5 Whys**
  * **Fishbone diagram** (optional)
  * **Log + Code analysis**
* Pinpoint the exact line, condition, or config causing it

---

### 🔹 4. **Document RCA Clearly**

📄 **RCA Template**:

```markdown
### 🛑 Incident Summary:
Login service failed for 20% of users between 10:05–10:45 AM IST.

### 📅 Timeline:
- 10:05 AM: Alert triggered
- 10:08 AM: Dev team acknowledged
- 10:15 AM: Identified DB connection saturation
- 10:35 AM: Restarted service with connection pool fix
- 10:45 AM: Service fully restored

### 🧠 Root Cause:
A recent deploy increased concurrent DB connections beyond pool limit.

### ✅ Fix Applied:
- Reduced pool size
- Added connection retries and monitoring

### 🔐 Prevention:
- Added circuit breaker
- Scheduled load test for weekends
- Monitoring alert on DB saturation
```

---

### 🔹 5. **Communicate to Stakeholders**

* Keep it **simple, transparent, and solution-focused**
* Share via:

  * Slack/Teams message (short version)
  * Email or doc link (detailed RCA)
  * Daily sync or retro meeting if high severity

---

### ✅ Sample Summary Message:

```
Hi team,  
Today's login issue was due to a DB connection pool overflow after a recent release. We’ve applied a fix and added new alerts to prevent recurrence. Detailed RCA is linked below 👇  
[Link to RCA Doc]
```

### ✅ Summary Line for Interview:

> "I conduct RCA using logs and the 5-Why method, document a clear timeline + root cause, and communicate in plain language with action items to both tech and non-tech stakeholders."
