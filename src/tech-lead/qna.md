Here is a hand-picked 🔥 **Tech Lead Q\&A Pack** – for leadership, architecture, and decision-making rounds:

---

### ✅ **1. How do you handle conflicts within your dev team?**

> I focus on **clarifying goals**, not opinions.
> I encourage both sides to explain their reasoning, align on the end objective (performance, maintainability, delivery), and facilitate a decision that prioritizes impact over ego.

---

### ✅ **2. How do you mentor junior developers?**

> I assign them real tasks with **safe review boundaries**, encourage asking “why”, and do **pair programming** or **code walkthroughs**.
> I also share patterns, reading links, and make their growth part of team OKRs.

---

### ✅ **3. How do you plan architecture for a new project?**

> I start with:

* Use-case + data flow
* Identify key modules
* Choose stack for scalability/velocity
* Define APIs/contracts
* Build a PoC or sequence diagrams

> All while keeping an eye on delivery phases and team strengths.

---

### ✅ **4. How do you manage tech debt?**

> I tag tech debt during sprints, quantify it (effort/risk), and push for **time-boxed cleanup tasks** post milestone or along with feature updates.

---

### ✅ **5. What’s your approach to code reviews?**

> I look for:

* Logic & edge cases
* Clarity & naming
* Test coverage
* Performance & security

> I give feedback that’s respectful, focused on learning, not blaming.

---

### ✅ **6. How do you ensure high code quality under deadlines?**

> I rely on **automation** (tests, lint, CI), strict PR reviews, reusable templates, and scoped architecture.
> I balance “what must be perfect” vs “what can be improved later”.

---

### ✅ **7. How do you handle a production incident?**

> Immediate steps:

* Alert → Contain → Rollback if needed
* RCA (root cause analysis) → Postmortem write-up
* Follow-up: Add test, monitoring, or fix

---

### ✅ **8. How do you help your team deliver on time?**

> I break features into mini-slices, unblock early, **track progress async**, and avoid over-estimating.
> I remove blockers, coordinate with QA, and keep Product updated.

---

### ✅ **9. How do you upskill yourself as a tech lead?**

> I read design docs, OSS code, follow changelogs, and do PoCs.
> I also write, teach, or refactor parts of the system regularly.

---

### ✅ **10. What is your leadership style?**

> I lead by **clarity, example, and consistency**.
> I protect the team from chaos, give autonomy, and ensure every voice is heard — but hold accountability high.
