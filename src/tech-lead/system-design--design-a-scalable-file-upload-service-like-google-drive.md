✅ Here's a full **System Design for a Scalable File Upload Service** like **Google Drive**, focused on:

> ☁️ **S3 Storage**, 📇 **Metadata Store**, 🛡️ **Virus Scanning**, 🔁 **Resumable Uploads**, and 📈 **Scalability**

---

## 🧭 1. **Core Requirements**

* Upload/download files of various types (PDF, images, videos)
* Support **large files** (GBs)
* Allow **pause/resume**
* **Scan for viruses**
* Store **file metadata**
* Handle millions of users and concurrent uploads

---

## 🧱 2. **High-Level Architecture**

```
[Client] 
  ↓
[Upload Gateway API] → [Auth Service]
  ↓
[Upload Session Service] → [Virus Scanner] → [S3/Blob Store]
                             ↓
                   [Metadata DB / File Index]
```

---

## ☁️ 3. **Storage (S3/Blob Store)**

* Store actual file content

* Organized by:

  ```
  /user_id/yyyy/mm/dd/file_id/part_number
  ```

* Use **Multipart Upload API** for:

  * Parallel upload of file chunks
  * Resume support
  * Auto clean-up for incomplete uploads

---

## 📇 4. **Metadata Store (RDBMS or MongoDB)**

| Field           | Description                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| file\_id        | Unique UUID                  |
| user\_id        | Who uploaded                 |
| filename        | Original file name           |
| file\_size      | Size in bytes                |
| mime\_type      | Content type                 |
| status          | uploaded / scanning / ready  |
| virus\_status   | clean / infected / unknown   |
| created\_at     | Timestamp                    |
| parts\_uploaded | Optional for resumable logic |

🔹 Use **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**
🔹 Index on `user_id`, `created_at`

---

## 🔄 5. **Resumable Upload**

* Initiate upload → generate `upload_id` (mapped to file\_id)
* Each chunk upload hits:

  ```
  PUT /upload/{upload_id}/part/{part_number}
  ```
* Store upload state in Redis/DB
* Use **S3 Multipart Upload API**

> After all parts are uploaded → call `CompleteMultipartUpload`

---

## 🛡️ 6. **Virus Scanning (ClamAV/3rd Party)**

* After upload, scan file in S3 via Lambda / scanner pod
* Update file status to:

  * ✅ Clean → file becomes available
  * ❌ Infected → delete or quarantine

### Queue Flow:

```
[Upload Completed] → Publish to Kafka → [Virus Scanner Worker] → Update Status
```

---

## ⚙️ 7. **Client Upload Flow**

1. `POST /upload/initiate` → returns `upload_id`
2. `PUT /upload/{upload_id}/part/{n}` → upload part
3. `POST /upload/{upload_id}/complete`
4. Backend sends scan job → updates file metadata
5. Frontend polls or uses WebSocket to watch status

---

## 🧪 8. **Download Flow**

* `GET /file/{file_id}` → check virus scan + auth
* Generate **presigned S3 URL**
* Client downloads securely from S3 (not backend)

---

## 📦 9. **Tech Stack Suggestion**

| Layer       | Tech Choices                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Frontend    | ReactJS + Axios + Resumable.js   |
| Backend     | Spring Boot / Node.js + REST     |
| File Store  | AWS S3 / GCP Storage / MinIO     |
| Metadata DB | PostgreSQL / MongoDB             |
| Virus Scan  | ClamAV (container) / API Gateway |
| Queue       | Kafka / SQS                      |
| Caching     | Redis (for sessions/state)       |
| Auth        | OAuth2 / Firebase Auth / JWT     |
| Infra       | Docker + K8s + Load Balancer     |

---

## 🔐 10. **Security**

* Authenticated access only
* File type & size validation
* Virus scan mandatory before download
* Expiring pre-signed download URLs
* Rate limiting + API gateway

---

## ⚡ 11. **Scalability Tips**

| Component  | Strategy                      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Upload API | Stateless + K8s-scaled        |
| Virus Scan | Parallel workers via queue    |
| S3         | Auto-scale backend storage    |
| DB         | Partition by user\_id or date |
| Cache      | Redis for active uploads      |

---

## ✅ Sequence Diagram (Simplified)

```
Client
  ↓
Initiate Upload → [Upload Service] → [S3 Multipart Init]
  ↓
Upload Part → [S3]
  ↓
Complete Upload → [S3 + DB]
  ↓
Kafka: "FileReady" → [Virus Scanner] → [DB: mark clean]
```

---

## Bonus Features

* 🔁 Versioning
* 🔍 Full-text search (Elastic)
* 🔔 Notification service for file status
* 🧾 Audit log of uploads/downloads
